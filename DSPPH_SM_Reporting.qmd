## In this chapter you will learn:

- how to report your hypothesis testing results (including visualizations) to communicate what your model says about your hypothesis.

:::

# Reporting your hypothesis testing results

To report your model, you want to communicate a number of things:  

* your best-specified model(s) 

* how well your model explains your response 

* your modelled effects 

In a few weeks, we will discuss communicating your hypothesis testing (including results) more formally - i.e. the text and visuals you will use to write your own scientific reports and papers.  In the current chapter, we will gather many of the pieces needed for that task.


# Introducing the examples:

In this chapter, we will report model results for four example best-specified models that showcase a range of different hypotheses.  

If you are re-reading this chapter with your own hypothesis you are testing, look for the example that shares the most structure with your own hypothesis.  

The examples are:  

Example 1: `Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1`

Example 2: `Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1`

Example 3: `Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1`

Example 4: `Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1`

where 

* `Resp#` is your response variable. 
* `Cat#` indicates a categorical predictor
* `Cont#` indicates a continuous predictor


Note that each example is testing a different hypothesis by fitting a different model to a different data-set.  The four examples are not related to one another. 

Note also that the examples will all involve a normal error distribution assumption.  I will point out when your process would be different for a different error distribution assumption (e.g. Gamma, poisson, and binomial)

Finally, note that I am not going through all the steps that got us to these example best-specified models, but assume we went through the previous steps (Response, Predictors, Hypothesis, Starting model, Model validation and Hypothesis testing) as we practiced in class to choose each best-specified model.

# Reporting your best-specified models 

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
This section is similar regardless of your model structure (e.g. error distribution assumption).  The examples below all assume a normal error distribution assumption but you can use the same process for models of any structure.
:::

Reporting your best-specified model means reporting the terms - the predictors and any interactions - that are in your model.  It is good practice to present the model along with the results from the model selection.  In this way, you can include multiple best-specified models if there is evidence that more than one might be useful.  Depending on your hypothesis and results, you may want to present all models within ∆AICc < 2 of the best-specified model, or all models with any Akaike weight, or simply all models.

Remember from the Hypothesis Testing chapter that you can also use the output from `dredge()` function to report evidence for how you picked the best-specified model. When we discuss communicating your hypothesis testing in a few weeks, I'll include some functions that can help make quick work of making a model selection table. 


Let's take a look at how you do this with our examples:

```

For Example 1, you will report that your best-specified model is `Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1`, i.e. that there is evidence that `Cat1` explains variability in `Resp1`.  This was chosen as the best-specified model as it had the lowest AICc and the next highest rank model had a ∆AICc of `r round(dredgeOut1$delta[2],2)` (i.e. ∆AICc > 2).  The best-specified model had an Akaike weight of `r round(dredgeOut1$weight[1],3)`.

This was chosen as the best-specified model as it had the lowest AICc and the next highest rank model had a ∆AICc of `r round(dredgeOut2$delta[2],2)` (i.e. ∆AICc > 2).  The best-specified model had an Akaike weight of `r round(dredgeOut2$weight[1],3)`.

# Reporting how well your model explains your response

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
This section is similar regardless of your model structure (e.g. error distribution assumption).  The examples below all assume a normal error distribution assumption but you can use the same process for models of any structure.
:::

In this section you will determine

* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance

## how much variation in your response is explained by your model

If you will recall, your whole motivation for pursuing statistical modelling was to explain variation in your response.  Thus, it is important that you quantify how much variation in your response you are able to explain by your model.

Note that **we will discuss this as "explained deviance" rather than "explained variation"**.  This is because the term "variance" is associated with models where the error distribution assumption is normal, whereas deviance is a more universal term.  

When you have a **normal error distribution assumption and linear shape assumption**, you can capture the amount of explained deviance simply by comparing the variance in your response (i.e. the starting variation *before* you fit your model - the null variation) vs. the variance in your model residuals (i.e. the remaining variation *after* you fit your model - the residual variation) as the $R^2$:

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{residual variation}{null variation}$

From this equation, you can see how, if your model is able to explain all the variation in the response, the residual variation will be zero, and $R^2 = 1$.  Alternatively, if the model explains no variation in the response the residual variation equals the null variation and $R^2 = 0$.

For models with **other error distribution and shape assumptions**, you need another way of estimating the goodness of fit of your model.  You can do this through a pseudo $R^2$.  

One useful pseudo $R^2$ is called the Likelihood Ratio $R^2$ or $R^2_{LR}$.  The $R^2_{LR}$ compares the likelihood of your best-specified model to the likelihood of the null model:

$R^2_{LR} = 1-exp(-\frac{2}{n}(log𝓛(model)-log𝓛(null)))$

where $n$ is the number of observations, $log𝓛(model)$ is the log-likelihood of your model, and $log𝓛(null)$ is the log-likelihood of the null model.  The $R^2_{LR}$ is the type of pseudo $R^2$ that shows up in your `dredge()` output when you add `extra = "R^2"` to the `dredge()` call.  You can calculate $R^2_{LR}$ by hand, read it from our `dredge()` output, or estimate it using `r.squaredLR()` from the MuMIn package:

```{r}
r.squaredLR(bestMod1)
```

Note here that two values of $R^2_{LR}$ are reported. The adjusted pseudo $R^2$ given here under `attr(,"adj.r.squared")` has been scaled so that $R^2_{LR}$ can reach a maximum of 1, similar to a regular $R^2$^[this is called the Nagelkerke's modified statistic - see `?r.squaredLR` for more information].

Let's compare this to the traditional $R^2$: 

```{r}
1-summary(bestMod1)$deviance/summary(bestMod1)$null.deviance
```

Note that the two estimates are similar: One nice feature of the $R^2_{LR}$ is that it is equivalent to the regular $R^2$ when our model assumes a normal error distribution assumption and linear shape assumption, so **you can use $R^2_{LR}$ for any of the models that we are discussing in class.**

## how important is each of your predictors in explaining that variation

When you have more than one predictor in your model. you may also want to report how relatively important each predictor is to explaining deviance in your response.  This is also called "partitioning the explained deviance" to the predictors.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true" title="Aside: what we won't be doing"} 

To get an estimate of how much deviance in your response one particular predictor explains, you may be tempted to compute the explained deviance ($R^2$) estimates of models fit to data with and without that particular predictor.  Let's try with our Example 4:

```{r}

dredgeOut4

```

If you want to get an estimate as to how much response deviance the `Cont6` predictor explains, you might compare the $R^2$ of a model with and without the `Cont6` predictor.

Let's compare comparing model #4 (that includes `Cont6`) and model #2 (that doesn't include `Cont6`):

```{r}
R2.mod4 <- (dredgeOut4$`R^2`[2]) # model #4 is the second row in dredgeOut4
R2.mod2 <- (dredgeOut4$`R^2`[3]) # model #2 is the third row in dredgeOut4

diffR2 <- R2.mod4 - R2.mod2 # find estimated contribution of Cont to explained deviance

diffR2
```

So it looks like `r round(diffR2,3)*100`% of the variability in `Resp4` is explained by `Cont6`.

But what if instead you chose to compare model #3 (that includes `Cont6`) and model #1 (that doesn't include `Cont6`):

```{r}
R2.mod3 <- (dredgeOut4$`R^2`[4]) # model #3 is the fourth row in dredgeOut4
R2.mod1 <- (dredgeOut4$`R^2`[5]) # model #1 is the fifth row in dredgeOut4

diffR2 <- R2.mod3 - R2.mod1 # find estimated contribution of Cont to explained deviance

diffR2
```

Now it looks like `r round(diffR2,3)*100`% of the variability in `Resp4` is explained by `Cont6`! Quite a different answer!  Your estimates of the contribution of `Cont6` to explaining the response deviation don't agree because of collinearity among our predictors^[see also the course notes from Model Validation].  

:::

There are a few options you can use to get a robust estimate of how much each predictor is contributing to explained deviance in your response.

One option for partitioning the explained deviance when you have collinearity among your predictors is hierarchical partitioning.  Hierarchical partitioning estimates the average independent contribution of each predictor to the total explained variance by considering all models in the candidate model set^[i.e. in the `dredge()` output].  This method is beyond the scope of the course but see the [rdacca.hp package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdacca.hp/index.html) for an example of how to do this.  

Another method (**that we will be using**) for estimating the importance of each term (predictor or interaction) in your model is by again looking at the candidate model set ranking made by `dredge()`.  Here you can measure the importance of a predictor by summing up the Akaike weights for any model that includes a particular predictor.  The Akaike weight of a model compares the likelihood of the model scaled to the total likelihood of all the models in the candidate model set.  The sum of Akaike weights for models including a particular predictor tells you how important the predictor is in explaining the deviance in your response.  You can calculate the sum of Akaike weights directly with the `sw()` function in the MuMIn package:

```{r}

sw(dredgeOut4)

```

Here we can see that all model terms (the predictors `Cat5` and `Cont6` as well as the interaction) are equally important in explaining the deviance in `Resp4` (they appear in all models that have any Akaike weight).  

Let's look at these two steps 

* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance

with our examples:

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1"} 

#### Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1

* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

```{r}
R2 <- r.squaredLR(bestMod1)

R2

```

The best-specified model explains `r round(data.frame(R2),3)*100`% of the deviance in `Resp1`.

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance


```{r}

dredgeOut2

```

```{r}

sw(dredgeOut1)

```


With Example 1, you have only one predictor (`Cat1`) and so this predictor is responsible for explaining all of the variability in your response (`Resp1`).  You can see that it appears in all models with any weight with your `sw()` function from the MuMIn package.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1"} 

#### Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1

* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

```{r}
R2 <- r.squaredLR(bestMod2)

R2

```

The best-specified model explains `r round(data.frame(R2),3)*100`% of the deviance in `Resp2`.

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance

```{r}

dredgeOut2

```


```{r}

sw(dredgeOut2)

```

Here you can see that `Cat2` and `Cat3` are equally important in explaining the deviance in `Resp2` (they appear in all models that have any Akaike weight), while the interaction term between `Cat2` and `Cat3` is less important (only appearing in one model with Akaike weight, though this is the top model).  


:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 3: Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1"} 

#### Example 3: Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1

* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

```{r}
R2 <- r.squaredLR(bestMod3)

R2

```

The best-specified model explains `r round(data.frame(R2),3)*100`% of the deviance in `Resp3`.

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance

```{r}

dredgeOut3

```


```{r}

sw(dredgeOut3)

```

With Example 3, you have only one predictor (`Cont6`) and so this predictor is responsible for explaining all of the variability in your response (`Resp3`).  You can see that it appears in all models with any weight with your `sw()` function from the MuMIn package.
 

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 4: Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1"} 

#### Example 4: Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1


* how much deviance in your response is explained by your model

```{r}
R2 <- r.squaredLR(bestMod4)

R2

```

The best-specified model explains `r round(data.frame(R2),3)*100`% of the deviance in `Resp2`.

* how important each of your predictors is in explaining that deviance

```{r}

dredgeOut4

```


```{r}

sw(dredgeOut4)

```

Here you can see that `Cat5`, `Cont6` and the interaction `Cat5:Cont6` are all equally important in explaining the deviance in `Resp4` (they appear in all models that have any Akaike weight).

# Reporting your modelled effects

In the last chapter of these notes, we discussed testing your hypothesis.  

Remember that testing your hypothesis is looking for evidence of **effects** of your predictors on your response.  By testing your hypothesis, you determined that there was evidence that the effects of your predictors on your response are non-zero.  

Here you will gather the information to communicate visually and quantitatively the magnitude and direction of your effects and determine (in some cases) where effects are similar or different from one another, answering questions like:

- how much does a change (effect) in your predictor change your response?

- is that change (effect) positive (your response) or negative (your response decreases)?

- is that change (effect) similar across levels of your categorical predictor?

You will report your modelled effects in two ways:

1) **Visualizing your model effects**: Here, you will make plots of your model effects including the effects themselves, uncertainty around the effects and your observations.  These plots will help communicate your modelled effects as well as how well your model fits your observations.

2) **Quantifying your model effects**: Here, you will report (in numbers) the magnitude and direction of your modelled effects along with the uncertainty. Exactly how you do that will depend on the structure of your model (e.g. the error distribution assumption).  We will go through a number of examples here. You will also look for evidence of whether modelled effects of a categorical predictor differ across all levels.  


## Visualizing your model effects

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
This section is similar regardless of your model structure (e.g. error distribution assumption).  The examples below all assume a normal error distribution assumption but you can use the same process for models of any structure.
:::

Here, you will visualize how each predictor is affecting the response by drawing how your modelled fitted values (the estimates of your response made by the model) change with your predictors, along with a measure of uncertainty around those fitted values.  You also want to include your data (actual observations of your response and predictors) so you can start to communicate how well your model captures your hypothesis, and what amount of deviance in your response is explained by your model.  

There are a lot of different R packages that make it easy to quickly visualize your model.  We will focus on two methods that will allow you to make quick visualizations of your model and/or customize the figures as you would like.

* *visualizing using the visreg package*: This will let you get a quick look at your model object with a limited amount of customization. 

* *vizualizing "by hand"*: Here, "by hand" is a bit of a silly description as R will be doing the work for you.  What I mean by "by hand" is that you will be building the plot yourself by querying your model object. This method is very flexible and will lead you to a fully customizable visualization.  This process involves i) choosing the values of your predictors at which to make estimates of your fitted values, ii) using `predict()` to use your model to estimate your response variable at those values of your predictors, and iii) use the model estimates to plot your model fit.  Aside: this is similar to what we will be doing when we learn about model predictions in the next chapter of these notes.

Below are visualizations for each of our examples. 



:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1"} 

###### Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1

**Visualizing with the visreg package** 

```{r include=FALSE}

install.packages("visreg")

```


```{r}

library (visreg) # load visreg package for visualization

library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 package for visualization

visreg(bestMod1, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cat1", # predictor on x-axis
       #by = ..., # if you want to include a 2nd predictor plotted as colour
       #breaks = ..., # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 3rd predictor
       #overlay = TRUE, # to plot as overlay or panels, when there is 
       #rug = FALSE, # to turn off the rug. The rug shows you where you have positive (appearing on the top axis) and negative (appearing on the bottom axis) residuals
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot, with ggplot, you will have more control over the look of the plot.
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat1, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme


```
Unfortunately due to limitations of the visreg package, you can not easily add you observations onto plots where the x-axis is a categorical predictor.  But that's ok, because there are other options...

**Visualizing by hand**

To plot by hand, you will 

i) first make a data frame containing the value of your predictors at which you want to plot effects on the response: 


```{r}

# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit
forCat1<-unique(myDat1$Cat1) # every value of your categorical predictor

# create a data frame with your predictors
forVis<-expand.grid(Cat1=forCat1) # expand.grid() function makes sure you have all combinations of predictors

```


ii) Next, you will use the `predict()` function^[you will be using the `predict()` function again in an upcoming chapter... when you predict!] to get the model estimates of your response variable at those values of your predictors:

```{r}

# Get your model fit estimates at each value of your predictors
modFit<-predict(bestMod1, # the model
                newdata = forVis, # the predictor values
                type = "response", # make the predictions on the response scale
                se.fit = TRUE) # include uncertainty estimate

forVis$Fit<-modFit$fit # add your fit to the data frame
forVis$Upper<-modFit$fit+modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame
forVis$Lower<-modFit$fit-modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame


```



iii) Finally, you will use these model estimates to make your plot:

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + # start ggplot
  geom_point(data = myDat1, # add observations to your plot
             mapping = aes(x = Cat1, y = Resp1), 
             position=position_jitter(width=0.1)) + # control position of data points so they are easier to see on the plot
  geom_errorbar(data = forVis, # add the uncertainty to your plot
              mapping = aes(x = Cat1, y = Fit, ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper),
              linewidth=1.2) + # control thickness of errorbar line
  geom_point(data = forVis, # add the modelled fit to your plot
              mapping = aes(x = Cat1, y = Fit), 
             shape = 22, # shape of point
             size = 3, # size of point
             fill = "white", # fill colour for plot
             col = 'black') + # outline colour for plot
  ylab("Resp1, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat1, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme

```

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1"} 

###### Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1

**Visualizing with the visreg package** 

As you have more than one predictor in Example 2, there are a number of ways you can visualize your effects.  

Here is an example of a visualization with `Cat2` on the x-axis and the effects of `Cat3` plotted as separate panels:

```{r}

library (visreg) # load visreg package for visualization

library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 package for visualization

visreg(bestMod2, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cat2", # predictor on x-axis
       by = "Cat3", # if you want to include a 2nd predictor plotted as colour
       #breaks = ..., # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 3rd predictor
       overlay = FALSE, # to plot as overlay or panels, when there is 
       #rug = FALSE, # to turn off the rug. The rug shows you where you have positive (appearing on the top axis) and negative (appearing on the bottom axis) residuals
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot, with ggplot, you will have more control over the look of the plot.
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat2, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme

# tip: we can't include our observations on this plot due to the limitations of the visreg package when plotting with a categorical predictor on the x-axis

```


And here is an example of a visualization with `Cat2` on the x-axis and the effects of `Cat3` overlayed on the plot as different colours for each category (level) of `Cat3`:

```{r}

visreg(bestMod2, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cat2", # predictor on x-axis
       by = "Cat3", # if you want to include a 2nd predictor plotted as colour
       #breaks = ..., # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 3rd predictor
       overlay = TRUE, # to plot as overlay or panels, when there is 
       #rug = FALSE, # to turn off the rug. The rug shows you where you have positive (appearing on the top axis) and negative (appearing on the bottom axis) residuals
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot, with ggplot, you will have more control over the look of the plot.
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 4: Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1"} 

###### Example 4: Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1


**Visualizing with the visreg package** 

As you will see in @sec_quantifying, there is no evidence of an effect of `Cont6` on `Resp3` when `Cat5 = Farm` - i.e. the coefficient (slope) is not different from zero.  In such cases, you would typically **not** include the effect on the plot (red line in the next figure), but I include it here to illustrate the visualization techniques.

A plot with `Cont6` on the x-axis:

```{r}

library (visreg) # load visreg package for visualization

library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 package for visualization

visreg(bestMod, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cont6", # predictor on x-axis
       by = "Cat5", # predictor plotted as colour
       #breaks = 3, # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 4th predictor
       overlay = TRUE, # to plot as overlay or panels 
       rug = FALSE, # to include a rug
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot
  geom_point(data = myDat4, # data
             mapping = aes(x = Cont6, y = Resp4, col = Cat5))+ # add data to your plot
  #ylim(0, 60)+ # adjust the y-axis units
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cont6, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme

```

A plot with `Cat5` on the x-axis: Notice how the continuous predictor is represented by different levels in the colours on the plot.  Here you've asked for three levels with `breaks = 3`.  Note that you can not include your observations on the visreg plot when the x-axis predictor is a category

```{r}


visreg(bestMod, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cat5", # predictor on x-axis
       by = "Cont6", # predictor plotted as colour
       breaks = 3, # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 4th predictor
       overlay = TRUE, # to plot as overlay or panels 
       rug = FALSE, # to include a rug
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat5, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  labs(fill="Cont6, (units)", col="Cont6, (units)") + # change legend title
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme

```

You can also specify at which levels the breaks should occur with the `breaks = ...` argument.  For example, you can ask visreg to plot the modelled effects when `Cont6` = 400 and `Cont6` = 600:

```{r}

visreg(bestMod, # model to visualize
       scale = "response", # plot on the scale of the response
       xvar = "Cat5", # predictor on x-axis
       by = "Cont6", # predictor plotted as colour
       breaks = c(400,600), # if you want to control how the colour predictor is plotted
       #cond = , # if you want to include a 4th predictor
       overlay = TRUE, # to plot as overlay or panels 
       rug = FALSE, # to include a rug
       gg = TRUE)+ # to plot as a ggplot
  ylab("Response, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat5, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  labs(fill="Cont6, (units)", col="Cont6, (units)") + # change legend title
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme


```

Note that you can not include your observations on the visreg plot when the x-axis predictor is a category.



**Visualizing by hand**

Here's an example with `Cont6` on the x-axis:

```{r}

#### i) choosing the values of your predictors at which to make a prediction


# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit

# create a data frame with your predictors
forVis<-expand.grid(Cat5 = forCat5, Cont6 = forCont6) # expand.grid() function makes sure you have all combinations of predictors.

# Get your model fit estimates at each value of your predictors

Here's an example with `Cat5` on the x-axis:

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="Aside: Plotting in 3D"} 

You might notice that many of the plots above are communicating 3-dimensions (one response + two predictors) in a 2-dimensional plot.  There are other ways of making 3-dimensional plots in R, e.g. with the visreg package using the `visreg2d()` function in the visreg package:


```{r}

visreg2d(fit = bestMod4, # your model
         xvar = "Cont6", # what to plot on the x-axis
         yvar = "Cat5", # what to plot on the y-axis
         scale = "response") # make sure fitted values (colours) are on the scale of the response

```

or "by hand" using the `geom_raster()` function in the ggplot2 package:

```{r}

# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit
forCont6<-seq(from = min(myDat4$Cont6), 
             to = max(myDat4$Cont6), 
             by = 0.1) # e.g. a sequence of Cont values
forCat5<-unique(myDat4$Cat5) # every value of your categorical predictor

# create a data frame with your predictors
forVis<-expand.grid(Cont6=forCont6, Cat5=forCat5) # expand.grid() function makes sure you have all combinations of predictors


# Get your model fit estimates at each value of your predictors
modFit<-predict(bestMod4, # the model
                newdata = forVis, # the predictor values
                type = "response", # make the predictions on the response scale
                se.fit = TRUE) # include uncertainty estimate

forVis$Fit<-modFit$fit # add your fit to the data frame
forVis$Upper<-modFit$fit+modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame
forVis$Lower<-modFit$fit-modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame

# create your plot
ggplot() + # start your ggplot
  geom_raster(data = forVis, aes(x = Cont6, y = Cat5, fill = Fit))+ # add the 3 dimensions as a raster
  geom_point(data = myDat4, aes(x = Cont6, y = Cat5, colour = Resp)) # add your data
```

**EXTRA**: As you can see, these plots represent the 3rd dimension by using colour.  You can also make actual 3 dimensional plots in R with the [plotly package](https://plotly.com/r/getting-started/).  These plots are interactive which makes them more useful than static 3d plots.  **Click on the plot and move your mouse to rotate the plot!**


```{r include=FALSE}

install.packages("plotly")

```

```{r}

library(plotly) # load the plotly package

plot_ly(data = forVis, # the data with your model predictions (made above)
        x = ~Cont6, # what to plot on the x axis
        y = ~Cat5, # what to plot on the y axis
        z = ~Fit, # what to plot on the z axis
        type="scatter3d", # type of plot
        mode="markers") %>% # type of plot
  add_markers(data = myDat4, x = ~Cont6, y = ~Cat5, z = ~Resp4) # add your data

## Quantifying your model effects {#sec_quantifying}

::: {.alert .alert-danger}
How you quantify your model effects varies with your model structure.  If it is your first time reading this, read through the examples that present models assuming a normal error distribution assumption.  This will help you understand why we are reporting modelled effects in this way.  Then, (if relevant) look at the section on the error distribution assumption you are interested in for your model. 
:::

In this section, you will learn how to report your modelled effects in numbers. In general, this section will involve answering:

* What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?

If you also have a categorical predictor with more than two levels, you will also want to answer:

* Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)

Let's examine each of these in turn:

### What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?

Recall from the text above that your model effects describe the change in your response given a change in your predictor.  

When you have a continuous predictor, this effect is the the amount of change in the response that is caused by a unit change in your continuous predictor.  Information about this effect is captured in the coefficient (slope) of the linear fit. Expand the text box below to see why.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="the math"} 

Here's a model equation for a generalized linear model:

$$
\begin{align}
g(\mu_i|Pred_i) &= \beta_1 \cdot Pred_i + \beta_0 \\
Resp_i &\sim F(\mu_i) 
\end{align}
$$

where 
* $g()$ is the link function
* $\mu_i$ is the mean fitted value $\mu_i$ dependent on $Pred_i$
* $\beta_1$ is the coefficient of $Pred_i$
* $Pred_i$ is the value of your predictor
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept
* $Resp_i$ is the value of the response variable
* $F$ represents some error distribution assumption



As above, the effect of a continuous predictor on your response is the change in your fitted value ($g(\mu_i)$) for a unit change in your predictor ($Pred_i$):

$$
\begin{align}
g(\mu|Pred+1) - g(\mu|Pred) &= (\beta_1 \cdot (Pred+1) + \beta_0) - (\beta_1 \cdot Pred_i + \beta_0) \\
&=\beta_1 \cdot Pred  + \beta_1 + \beta_0 - \beta_1 \cdot Pred_i - \beta_0 \\
&=\beta_1
\end{align}
$$
For linear models with a normal error distribution assumption (i.e. when you are using `link = "identity"`), the link function $g()$ is not there.  For this reason, you can read the effects of your model directly from the model coefficients ($\beta_1$, $\beta_0$) when you have a normal error distribution assumption.  And for this reason, you will need to convert your model coefficients to quantify your modelled effects when you have an error distribution assumption that is not normal/uses a link function that isn't "identity".  


<img src="./linkVsResponse.png" align="right" width="300px"/>

This is because of the difference between the "link" scale and "response" scale for generalized linear models.

The link scale is where the model fitting happens, and where the evidence for your modelled effects is gathered.

The response scale is back in the real world - these are the actual effects in your response you would expect to see with a change in your predictor.
<br clear="right"/>

Recall that you can see the default link functions associated with each error distribution function with `?family`:

<img src="./familyLinks.png" width="300px"/>

:::

When you have a categorical predictor, the coefficient represents the intercept of the linear fit and how that intercept changes as you move from one category to another.  So if you have a categorical predictor with 3 categories (levels), you will have three coefficients that describe how the mean of your response changes as you move from category to category.

When you have an interaction among your predictors, you will have one coefficient for each combination in your interaction. 

Finally, you need to report the uncertainty around your modelled effects so your peers know how much evidence there is for these modelled effects.  There are a number of ways to do this.  Two that we will use are i) reporting standard errors (SE) which are a measure of uncertainty of the average modelled effect, and ii) the 95% confidence intervals around your modelled effects, which tell you the range your modelled effects would be expected to fall into (with a 95% probability) if you redid your experiment.  

These principles are true regardless of your model structure BUT our interpretation of what the effects mean in the real world will vary based on e.g. your error distribution assumptions (see the text box above for an explanation).  In the examples below, you will learn how to quantify your modelled effects and uncertainty estimates for models with a normal error distribution assumption.  There are sections below to show you how to do the same for models with other error distribution assumptions.

For a quick summary, here is how the method depends on your modelled error distribution assumption:

<img src="./convertCoef.png" width="700px"/>


  

### Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors)

When you have a categorical predictor in your best-specified model, you know there is evidence of an effect for at least one of your levels (categories).  This step will tell you where you have evidence that the effects among your factor levels differ.  The processes outlined below are the same for any model structure. 

### Models with a normal error distribution assumption: {#sec-normalModelEffects}



:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1"} 

###### Example 1: Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1


Recall that Example 1 contains only one predictor and it is categorical:

`Resp1 ~ Cat1 + 1`


**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

In the chapter on your Starting Model, you found your coefficients in the "Estimate" column of the `summary()` output of your model: 

```{r echo = FALSE}

forText <- coef(summary(bestMod1)) # extract the coefficients from summary()

```


```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod1)) # extract the coefficients from summary()

```

Interpreting the coefficients from this output takes practice - especially for categorical predictors because of the way that R treats categorical predictors in regression.  With R's "dummy coding", one level of the predictor (here `Sp1`) is incorporated into the intercept estimate (`r round(forText["(Intercept)","Estimate"],1)`) as the reference level.  The other coefficients in the Estimate column represent the change in modelled response when you move from the reference level (`Sp1`) to another level.  

The modelled response when Cat1 = Sp2 is (`r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1)`)  units higher than this reference level =  `r round(forText["(Intercept)","Estimate"],1)` + `r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1)` = `r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1) + round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1)` units.  

The modelled `Resp1` when Cat1 = Sp3 is `r round(forText["Cat1Sp3","Estimate"],1)` units **lower** than the reference level =  `r round(forText["(Intercept)","Estimate"],1)` + `r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1)` = `r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Estimate"],1) + round(forText["Cat1Sp3","Estimate"],1)` units.^[note that the p-values reported in the coefficient table are the result of a test of whether the coefficient associated with `Sp2` is different than that of `Sp1` (p = `r round(forText["Cat1Sp2","Pr(>|t|)"],3)`), and if the effect of `Sp3` is different than that of `Sp1` (p = `r round(forText["Cat1Sp3","Pr(>|t|)"],3)`)), but a comparison of effects of `Sp2` vs. `Sp3` is missing.  We will discuss this more further along in these notes.] 

So all the information we need is in this `summary()` output, but not easy to see immediately.  An easier way is to use the emmeans^[emmeans stands for "estimated marginal means"] package which helps you by reporting the coefficients directly.  In our case, you use the emmeans package to get the mean value of the response at each level of the predictor.  For categorical predictors, you do this with the `emmeans()` function: 

```{r include=FALSE}

install.packages("emmeans")

```


```{r}

library(emmeans) # load the emmeans package

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod1, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut

```

So now you have a modelled value of your response for each level of your categorical predictor - this captures the effect of your categorical predictor on your response.  You also need to report uncertainty around this effect, and you can do this by reporting the standard error (SE) also reported by the `emmeans()` function.

When Cat1 is Sp1, Resp1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[1], 1)` ± `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$SE[1],1)` units.  
When Cat1 is Sp2, Resp1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[2], 1)` ± `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$SE[2],1)` units.  
When Cat1 is Sp3, Resp1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[3], 1)` ± `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$SE[3],1)` units.  

Note that this is the same information in the `summary()` output just easier to read.^[note that the `summary()` output becomes easier to read if you force the starting model not to have an intercept with: `startMod<-glm(formula = Resp1 ~ Cat1 - 1, data = myDat, family = gaussian(link="identity"))`. This is fine to do here where you **only** have categorical predictors but causes problems when you start having continuous predictors in your model as well.  So we won't be practicing this in class and instead will use the very flexible and helpful emmeans package to help us report coefficients from our statistical models.]

Note also that two types of uncertainty are measured here.  `SE` stands for the standard error around the prediction, and is a measure of uncertainty of the average modelled effect.  The `lower.CL` and `upper.CL` represent the 95% confidence limits of the prediction - so if I observed a new `Resp1` at a particular `Cat1`, there would be a 95% chance it would lie between the bounds of the confidence limits.  

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`. 

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

Since you have a categorical predictor with more than two levels, you will ask if all levels of `Cat1` affect `Resp1` in the same way - i.e. are the coefficients across factor levels significantly different from one another?

To get evidence about how each level affects your response, you need to test which effects differ from one another among the categories (levels) of your categorical predictor.  This is done using multiple comparisons, i.e. you will compare the modelled effect of each level of your categorical predictor vs. each other level of your categorical predictor to determine which are different from each other (called pairwise testing).  

This is done by testing the null hypothesis that the modelled effects of each pair are similar to one another, typically rejecting the null hypothesis when P < 0.05. Remember that the P-value is the probability that you observe a value at least as big as the one you observed even though our null hypothesis is true.  In this case, you are looking at the value you are observing is the difference between coefficients estimated for two levels of your predictor.  The P-value is the probability of getting a difference at least as big as the one you observed even though there is actually no difference between the coefficients (the null hypothesis is true).

A couple of things to note about multiple comparison testing:

1) Multiple comparison testing on a categorical predictor should only be done after your hypothesis testing has given you evidence that the predictor has an effect on your response.  That is, you should only do a multiple comparison test on a predictor if that predictor is in your best-specified model.  As this is a test done after your hypothesis testing, it is called a post-hoc^["post hoc" is a Latin phrase meaning "after the event"] test.  

2) Multiple comparison testing can be a problem because you are essentially repeating a hypothesis test many times on the same data (i.e. are the effects of `Sp1` different than those of `Sp2`?  are the effects of `Sp1` different than those of `Sp3`? are the effects of `Sp2` different than those of `Sp3`?...).  These repeated tests mean there is a high chance that you will find a difference in one test **purely due to random chance**, vs. due to there being an actual difference.  To account for this, the multiple comparison tests you will perform have been formulated to correct for this increased error.

Multiple comparison testing is very simple with the emmeans package.  It just requires you to hand the output from `emmeans()` to a function called `pairs()`:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut)

forComp

```

The output shows the results of the multiple comparison (pairwise) testing.  The values in the p.value column tell you the results of the hypothesis test comparing the coefficients between the two levels of your categorical predictor.  For example, for `Sp1` vs. `Sp2`, there is a `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)*100`% (p = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)`) probability of getting a difference in coefficients at least as big as `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[2], 1)` - `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[1], 1)` = `r `r round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[2], 1) - round(summary(emmeans(object = bestMod1, specs = ~ Cat1, type = "response"))$emmean[1], 1)` even though the null hypothesis (no difference) is true. This value `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)*100`% (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)`) is small enough that you can say you have evidence that the effect of Cat1 on Resp1 is different for these two different levels (`Sp1` and `Sp2`).

Based on a threshold p-value of 0.05, we can see that:

There is evidence that the value of `Resp1` when `Cat1` is `Sp1` is different (lower) than that when `Cat1` is `Sp2` as P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)` is less than P = 0.05.  
There is a little evidence that the value of `Resp1` when `Cat1` is `Sp1` is different (higher) than that when `Cat1` is `Sp3` as P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[2],4)` is less than P = 0.05 (but it is close!).
There is some evidence that the value of `Resp1` when `Cat1` is `Sp2` is different (higher) than that when `Cat1` is `Sp3` as P < 0.0001^[when the P-value is very low, R reports is as simple <.0001] is smaller than P = 0.05.^[note that now you get to assess the difference between coefficients for `Sp2` and `Sp3` which was missing in the `summary()` output above].

Note that the p-values have been adjusted via the Tukey method which adjusts the difference that the two coefficients need to have to allow for the fact that we are making multiple comparisons.^[The emmeans package is very flexible and has a lot of options as to how to make these corrections depending on your needs. Plenty more information is available 
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html)]

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

Note that the difference between `Resp1` when `Cat1` is Sp1 vs. Sp3 is so close to overlapping zero.  This is reflected in the high P value.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1"} 

###### Example 2: Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1

Recall that Example 2 contains two predictors and both are categorical:

`Resp2 ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3 + 1`

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

Again, for categorical predictors, there is a coefficient estimated for each level of the predictor.  If there is one or more interactions among predictors, there will be one coefficient for each combination of levels among predictors. Let's look at the `summary()` output of your model to understand better: 

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod2)) # extract the coefficients from summary()

```
Comparing this output to that of Example 1 shows many more estimated coefficients for Example 2.  This is because we have one coefficient for each level of each predictor, as well as coefficients for each combination (the interaction term) of levels of the predictors.  

Again, it takes a little practice to read the coefficients from the `summary()` output.  For Example 2:

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeA` and `Cat3` is `Treat1` is 365 units (the intercept).  

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeB` and `Cat3` is `Treat1` is 365 + 37 = `r 365+37` units.  

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeA` and `Cat3` is `Treat2` is 365 - 44 = `r 365-44` units.  

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeC` and `Cat3` is `Treat2` is 365 - 76 - 44 + 74 = `r 365 - 76 - 44 + 74` units.

As above, we can use the emmeans package to more easily see these coefficients:

```{r}


emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod2, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut



```

So now we have a modelled value of our response for each level of our categorical predictor.  For example:  

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeA` and `Cat3` is `Treat1` is 365 +/- 25 units.

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeB` and `Cat3` is `Treat1` is 402 +/- 22 units.

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeA` and `Cat3` is `Treat2` is 321 +/- 27 units.

The modelled prediction for `Resp2` when `Cat2` is `TypeC` and `Cat3` is `Treat2` is 319 +/- 33 units.  

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`.


**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

As with Example 1, you can also find out which combinations of predictor levels are leading to statistically different model predictions in `Resp2`:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut)

forComp

```
This is a hard table to navigate as every possible combination of the levels across predictors is compared.  This may not be what you want.  Instead, you can look for differences of one predictor based on a value of another. For example:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut, # emmeans output
                 simple = "Cat2") # contrasts within this categorical predictor

forComp

```

Here you can more easily see the contrasts, and the adjustment to the P-value will be limited to what you actually need.  Based on a threshold P-value of 0.05, you can see that the effects at some combinations of your predictors are not statistically different from each other.  

For example, the coefficient (predicted `Resp2`) when `Cat3` = `Treat1` and `Cat2` = `TypeA` is 365 and this is 37 lower than the coefficient when `Cat3` = `Treat1` and `Cat2` = `TypeB`, but there is no evidence that the difference has any meaning as P = 0.67 for this comparison.  

On the other hand, some combinations of your predictors are statistically different from each other.  For example, a comparison of modelled `Resp2` when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeB` (548) vs. `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeD` (215) shows that they differ by 333 and that there is strong evidence that this difference is meaningful as P < 0.001.  

Note that you could also organize this with contrasts by `Cat3` instead:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut, # emmeans output
                 simple = "Cat3") # contrasts within this categorical predictor

forComp

```


Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example 3: Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1"} 

###### Example 3: Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1

Recall that Example 3 contains one predictor and the predictor is continuous: 

`Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1`

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

For a continuous predictor, the effect is captured in one coefficient that describes the change in the response for a unit change in the continuous predictor.  For models with a normal error distribution assumption, this is communicated as the slope.  


Let's look at the `summary()` output for Example 3:  

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod3)) # extract the coefficients from summary()

```

This tells you that for a unit change in `Cont4`, you get a 260 ± 15^[* in units of `Resp3` per units of `Cont4`]. 

Note that this same information is in the emmeans package.  Because `Cont4` is a continuous predictor, you need the `emtrends()` function, which provides the 95% confidence interval on the estimate:

```{r}

trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod3,  # your model
                      specs = ~ Cont4 + 1, # your predictors
                      var = "Cont4") # your continuous predictors

trendsOut

```

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

This question is only applies to categorical predictors of which there are none in Example 3.

Recall that Example 4 contains two predictors, one is categorical and one is continuous:

`Resp4 ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1`

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

The effects estimated for this model will include values of the response (`Resp4`) at each level of the categorical predictor (`Cat5`) as well as slopes describing the change in the response when the continuous predictor (`Cont6`) changes, and a different slope will be estimated for each level in `Cat5` (this is because of the interaction in the model).  

As above, you can take a look at your modelled coefficients with the `summary()` output: 

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod4))

```
This shows:

The model prediction of `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Farm` and `Cont6` is 0 is 98.34 units^[units of `Resp4`] (the intercept).

The model prediction of `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Urban` and `Cont6` is 0 is 98.34 - 0.24 = `r round(98.34 - 0.24,1)` units.

The model prediction of `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Wild` and `Cont6` is 0 is 98.34 - 0.87 = `r round(98.34 - 0.87,1)` units.

The **slope** of the relationship between `Cont6` and `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Farm` is -0.0029.^[units will be the units of `Resp4` divided by those of `Cont6`]

The **slope** of the relationship between `Cont6` and `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Urban` is -0.0029 + 0.015 = `r -0.0029 + 0.015`.

The **slope** of the relationship between `Cont6` and `Resp4` when `Cat5` is `Wild` is -0.0029 + 0.031 = `r -0.0029 + 0.031`.


Again, interpreting the coefficients from the `summary()` output is tedious and not necessary: You can use the emmeans package to give you the modelled response for each level of the categorical predictor (`Cat5`) directly:

```{r}

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod4, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut



```
Note that `emmeans()` sets our continuous predictor (`Cont6`) to the mean value of `Cont6` (510 units).  We can also control this with the `at = ` argument:

```{r}



emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod4, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response", # report coefficients on the response scale
            at = list(Cont6 = 0)) # control the value of your continuous predictor at which to make the coefficient estimates


emmOut


```
By setting `at = 0`, you get the intercept - i.e. the modelled `Resp4` when `Cont6` = 0 for each level of `Cat5`, and this is what is reported in the `summary()` output.


Similarly, you can get the emmeans package to give you the slope coefficients for the continuous predictor (`Cont6`) using the `emtrends()` function, rather than interpreting them from the `summary()` output:

```{r}

trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod4,  # your model
                      specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
                      var = "Cont6") # your continuous predictors


trendsOut

```
Note that the 95% confidence limits for the modelled effect for `Cont6` when `Cat5` = `Farm` includes zero.  We can also see this with the `test()` function.

```{r}

test(trendsOut) # get test if coefficient is different than zero.

```
combining the two output, we can report that:

* there is no evidence on an effect on `Resp4` of `Cont6` when `Cat5` = `Farm` (p = 0.44).  

* there is evidence for a positive effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4` when `Cat5` = `Urban`.  The effect is 0.012^[in units of `Resp4` per units of `Cont6`] with a 95% confidence interval of 0.0039 - 0.0205^[in units of `Resp4` per units of `Cont6`].

* there is evidence for a positive effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4` when `Cat5` = `Wild`.  The effect is 0.028^[in units of `Resp4` per units of `Cont6`] with a 95% confidence interval of 0.0182 - 0.0377^[in units of `Resp4` per units of `Cont6`].

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

<img src="./checkSlopesFirst.png" align="right" width="300px"/>

Since you have a categorical predictor with more than two levels, you will want to report where the effects among levels differ from one another.

Note that the effects in Example 4 include slope coefficients (associated with the continuous predictor) and intercept coefficients (associated with the categorical predictor).  Because the slope and intercept are dependent on one another (when the slope changes, the intercept will naturally change), you need to first check if the slope coefficients vary across your categorical levels.  Only if they **don't** vary (i.e. the modelled effects produce lines that are parallel across your categorical levels) would you go on to test if the intercept coefficiens vary across your categorical levels.  
<br clear="right"/>

You can find out which slopes (i.e. the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4`) are different across the levels of `Cat5` using `emtrends()` with a request for pairwise testing:

```{r}

forCompSlope <- pairs(trendsOut)

forCompSlope

```
Here you see that the slope estimates (the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4`) for all levels of `Cat5` are significantly different from one another (0.0001 ≤ P ≤ 0.044).

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

Again: only if all the slopes were similar, would you want to test if the levels of your categorical predictor (`Cat4`) have significantly different coefficients (intercepts) from each other.  You would do this with `pairs()` on the output from `emmeans()` (the `emmOut` object).

### Models with a poisson error distribution assumption: {#sec-poissonModelEffects}

**Background**

For models with a poisson error distribution assumption, you will typically start with a link function that is the natural logarithm or `link = "log"`.  You need to take this link function into consideration when you report your modelled effects.

<img src="./poisExampleCoefficients.png" align="right" width="300px"/>

If you are using `link = "log"` (as with a poisson error distribution, and sometimes also a Gamma error distribution - more on this to come), you get your coefficient on the response scale by taking `e` to the coefficient on the link scale (with the R function `exp()`).  This coefficient is called the rate ratio^[also called the incidence rate ratio, incidence density ratio or relative risk] and it tells you the % change in the response for a unit change in your predictor.  

<br clear="right"/>

For a continuous predictor, the effect is captured in one coefficient that describes the change in the response for a unit change in the continuous predictor.  

For models with a normal error distribution assumption, this was simply a slope.  

For models using a log link (including many models with a poisson error distribution assumption), this is communicated as the rate ratio or the % change in the response for a unit change in your predictor.  This allows you to communicate the effect of the continuous predictor while accounting for the curve in the relationship (see visualization of model effects above).  This curve occurs because the model is not allowed to go below zero to be consistent with a poisson error distribution assumption.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="the math"} 

<!--- could estimate it directly with prediction like in figure--->

But why do we convert coefficients from the link to response scale with $e^x$^[a reminder that the number `e` that the function `exp()` uses as its base is Euler's number.  It (along with the natural logarithm, `log()`) is used to model exponential growth or decay, and can be used here when you want models where the response can not be below zero.] when `link = "log"`?

A reminder that we can present our linear model like this:

$$
\begin{align}
g(\mu_i|Pred_i) &= \beta_1 \cdot Pred_i + \beta_0 \\
Resp_i &\sim F(\mu_i) 
\end{align}
$$

where 
* $g()$ is the link function
* $\mu_i$ is the mean fitted value $\mu_i$ dependent on $Pred_i$
* $\beta_1$ is the coefficient of $Pred_i$
* $Pred_i$ is the value of your predictor
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept
* $Resp_i$ is the value of the response variable
* $F$ represents some error distribution assumption

If you have an error distribution assumption ($F$), the link function $g()$ is $log_e$^[this is what R uses when you say `link = "log"`]:

$$
\begin{align}
log_e(\mu_i|Pred_i) &= \beta_1 \cdot Pred_i + \beta_0 \\
Resp_i &\sim poisson(\mu_i) 
\end{align}
$$

Then the rate ratio (RR), or % change in the response for a unit change in the predictor becomes,

$$
\begin{align}
RR&=\frac{(\mu_i|Pred = a+1)}{(\mu_i|Pred = a)}\\[2em]
log_e(RR)&=log_e(\frac{(\mu_i|Pred = a+1)}{(\mu_i|Pred = a)})\\[2em]
log_e(RR)&=log_e(\mu_i|Pred = a+1)-log_e(\mu_i|Pred = a)\\[2em]
log_e(RR)&=(\beta_1\cdot (a+1)+\beta_0)-(\beta_1\cdot (a)+\beta_0)\\[2em]
log_e(RR)&=\beta_1\cdot a + \beta_1+\beta_0-\beta_1\cdot a-\beta_0\\[2em]
log_e(RR)&=\beta_1\\[2em]
RR &=e^{\beta_1}
\end{align}
$$

:::


One thing to note: 

The `emmeans()` function **will** convert the coefficients (intercepts) from the link to the response scale.  You can ask for this with the `type = "response"` argument.  

In contrast, the `emtrends()` function **does not** convert the coefficients (slopes) to represent effects on the response scale.  This is because `emtrends()` is reporting the slope of a straight line - the trend line on the link scale.  But the line isn't straight on the response scale.  

We need to convert from the link to the response by hand when we use `emtrends()`^[remember, the coefficients for categorical predictors are also being converted from the link to the response scale.  It is just that R is doing it for us in the `emmeans()` function when we add the argument `type = "response").  How we make the conversion, and interpret the result, will depend on our error distribution assumption: 

<img src="./convertCoef.png" width="700px"/>

Here we will go through examples of reporting for models with a poisson error distribution assumption.  If you want more details on *why* you are using the methods below, check the section on "Models with a normal error distribution assumption" (@sec-normalModelEffects) for context.


**Examples**

Here I have made new examples where the error distribution assumption is poisson.  This changes the response variables, indicated by `Resp1.p`, `Resp2.p`, etc. to be integers ≥ 0.

Recall that Example 1 contains only one predictor and it is categorical:

`Resp1.p ~ Cat1 + 1`

The best-specified model (now with poisson error distribution assumption) is:

```{r}

bestMod1.p

```
that was fit to data in `myDat1.p`:

```{r}

str(myDat1.p)

```

and the `dredge()` table you used to pick your `bestMod1.p` is in `dredgeOut1.p`
```{r}

dredgeOut1.p

```

And here's a visualization of the model effects:

```{r}

```

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

For categorical predictors, you can get the coefficients on the response scale directly with the `emmeans()` function^[from the emmeans package] when you specify type = "response": 

```{r}

library(emmeans) # load the emmeans package

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod1.p, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat1 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut

```
Notice that the column reported is "rate": these are the coefficients converted back onto the response scale.  

Note also that two types of uncertainty are measured here.  `SE` stands for the standard error around the prediction, and is a measure of uncertainty of the average modelled effect.  The `lower.CL` and `upper.CL` represent the 95% confidence limits of the prediction - so if I observed a new `Resp1.p` at a particular `Cat1`, there would be a 95% chance it would lie between the bounds of the confidence limits.  

From this output you see: 

When Cat1 is SpA, Resp1.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,6])` units).  
When Cat1 is SpB, Resp1.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,6])` units).
When Cat1 is SpC, Resp1.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,6])` units).

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`. 


**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

Here you can compare the effects of the levels of `Cat1` on `Resp1.p` to see if the effects differ between the levels.  

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut)

forComp

```

The output shows the results of the multiple comparison (pairwise) testing.  

The values in the `p.value` column tell you the results of the hypothesis test comparing the coefficients between the two levels of your categorical predictor.  

For example: 


* there is evidence that `Resp1.p` is significantly larger when `Cat 1 = SpA` than when `Cat1 = SpB` (p = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)`).  `Resp1.p` is expected to be ~ `r (round(summary(forComp)[1,2],2)-1)*100` ± `r (round(summary(forComp)[1,3],2))*100`% bigger when `Cat 1 = SpA` than when `Cat 1 = SpB`.

* there is evidence that `Resp1.p` is significantly smaller when `Cat 1 = SpA` than when `Cat1 = SpC` (p = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[2],4)`).  `Resp1.p` is expected to be ~ `r (1-round(summary(forComp)[2,2],2))*100` ± `r (round(summary(forComp)[2,3],2))*100`% smaller when `Cat 1 = SpA` than when `Cat 1 = SpC`.

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

             position=position_dodge(width=0.75)) + # control position of data points so they are easier to see on the plot
  ylab("Resp2.p, (units)")+ # change y-axis label
  xlab("Cat2, (units)")+ # change x-axis label
  labs(fill="Cat3, (units)", col="Cat3, (units)") + # change legend title
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme



```

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

As above, we can use the emmeans package to see the effects of the predictors on the scale of the response:

```{r}


emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod2.p, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut

```

So now we have a modelled value of our response for each level of our categorical predictors.  For example:  

The modelled prediction for `Resp2.p` when `Cat2` is `TypeA` and `Cat3` is `Treat` is 15.2 (95% confidence interval: 12.1 - 19.0 units).

The modelled prediction for `Resp2.p` when `Cat2` is `TypeC` and `Cat3` is `Control` is 9.7 units  (95% confidence interval: 6.7 - 13.9 units).

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`.


**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

As with Example 1, you can also find out which combinations of predictor levels are leading to statistically different model predictions in `Resp2.p`:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut, # emmeans output
                 simple = "Cat2") # contrasts within this categorical predictor

forComp

```

Here you can more easily see the contrasts.  Contrast ratios similar to 1 mean that the predictor levels lead to a similar value of the response. 

Based on a threshold P-value of 0.05, you can see that the effects at some combinations of your predictors are not statistically different from each other.  For example, the coefficient (predicted `Resp2.p`) when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeA` (15.2) is 1.4 times (or 40%) more than the predicted `Resp2.p` when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeB` (10.9), but there is no evidence that the difference has any meaning as P = 0.16 for this comparison.  

On the other hand, some combinations of your predictors are statistically different from each other.  For example, a comparison of modelled `Resp2.p` when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeB` (10.9) is 2.6 times (or 160%) higher than when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `TypeD` (4.2) and there is strong evidence that this difference is meaningful as P < 0.0027.  

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

and the dredge() table you used to pick your `bestMod3.p` is

```

And here's a visualization of the model effects:

```{r}

              size = 1.2) + # control thickness of line
  
    geom_line(data = forVis, # add uncertainty to your plot (upper line)

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

```{r}


trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod3.p,
                      specs = ~ Cont4 + 1, # your predictors
                      var = "Cont4") # your predictor of interest

trendsOut

```

Note that these are the same estimates as we find in the summary() of your model object

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod3.p))

```

This is an estimate of the modelled effects in the linked world.  We need to consider our log link function to report the modelled effects in the response world.

Since you have a poisson error distribution assumption, you can convert the estimate made by `emtrends()` on to the response scale with:

```{R}

trendsOut.df <- data.frame(trendsOut) # convert trendsOut to a dataframe

RR <- exp(trendsOut.df$Cont4.trend) # get the coefficient on the response scale

RR

```

We can also use the same conversion on the confidence limits of the modelled effect, for the upper:

```{r}

RR.up <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL) # get the upper confidence interval on the response scale
  
RR.up

```

and lower 95% confidence level:
``` {r}
  
RR.low <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL) # get the lower confidence interval on the response scale

RR.low
  

```


This tells you that for a unit change in `Cont4`, `Resp3` increases by `r round(RR,3)`x (95% confidence interval is `r round(RR.low,3)` to `r round(RR.up,3)`) which is an increase of `r round((RR -1)*100,2)`%. 

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

This question is only applies to categorical predictors of which their on none in Example 3.

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

The process for estimating effects of categorical vs. continuous predictors is different.

For categorical predictors (`Cat5`), you can use `emmeans()` to give you the effects on the response scale directly:

```{r}

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod4.p, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut
```

When Cat5 is StA, Resp4.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,6])` units).  
When Cat5 is StB, Resp4.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,6])` units).
When Cat5 is StC, Resp4.p is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,2])` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,5])` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,6])` units).

For continuous predictors (`Cont6`), you need to use the `emtrends()` function **and then convert the coefficients to the response scale**:

```{r}


trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod4.p,
                      specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
                      var = "Cont6") # your predictor of interest

trendsOut


```


Since you have a poisson error distribution assumption, you can convert the estimate made by `emtrends()` on to the response scale with the `exp()` function:

```{R}

trendsOut.df <- data.frame(trendsOut) # convert trendsOut to a dataframe

RR <- exp(trendsOut.df$Cont6.trend) # get the coefficient on the response scale

RR

```

You can also use the same conversion on the confidence limits of the modelled effect, for the upper:

```{r}

RR.up <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL) # get the upper confidence interval on the response scale
  
RR.up

```

and lower 95% confidence level:
``` {r}
  
RR.low <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL) # get the lower confidence interval on the response scale

RR.low
  

```

Let's organize these numbers so we can read the effects easier:

```{r}
RRAll <- data.frame(Cat5 = trendsOut.df$Cat5, # include info on the Cat5 level
                    RR = exp(trendsOut.df$Cont6.trend), # the modelled effect as a rate ratio
                    RR.up = exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL), # upper 95% confidence level of the modelled effect
                    RR.down = exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL)) # lower 95% confidence level of the modelled effect

RRAll

```

This tells you that for a unit change in `Cont6`, `Resp4.p`

* increases by `r round(RRAll[1, "RR"],3)` times (an increase of `r round((RRAll[1, "RR"] -1)*100,2)`%) when `Cat5` is `StA` (95% confidence interval: `r round(RRAll[1, "RR.down"],3)` to `r round(RRAll[1, "RR.up"],3)`).

* increases by `r round(RRAll[2, "RR"],3)` times (an increase of `r round((RRAll[2, "RR"] -1)*100,2)`%) when `Cat5` is `StB` (95% confidence interval: `r round(RRAll[2, "RR.down"],3)` to `r round(RRAll[2, "RR.up"],3)`).

* increases by `r round(RRAll[3, "RR"],3)` times (an increase of `r round((RRAll[3, "RR"] -1)*100,2)`%) when `Cat5` is `StC` (95% confidence interval: `r round(RRAll[3, "RR.down"],3)` to `r round(RRAll[3, "RR.up"],3)`).

Note that the 95% confidence interval for the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` (the rate ratio) includes 1.  When the rate ratio is 1, there is no effect of the continuous predictor on the response.  See @sec-poissonModelEffects for more explanation on this.  

You can test for evidence that the effects of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` are significant with: 

```{r}

test(trendsOut) # get test if coefficient is different than zero.

```
Note that these tests are done on the link scale but can be used for reporting effects on the response scale.

From the results, you can see that: 

* there is evidence that there is an effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` when `Cat5` = `StA`. (i.e. the slope on the link scale is different than zero, and the rate ratio on the response scale is different than 1; P < 0.0001).  

* there is *no* evidence that there is an effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` when `Cat5` = `StB`. (i.e. the slope on the link scale is *not* different than zero, and the rate ratio on the response scale is *not* different than 1; P = 0.32).  

* there is evidence that there is an effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` when `Cat5` = `StC`. (i.e. the slope on the link scale is different than zero, and the rate ratio on the response scale is different than 1; P < 0.0001).  

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

You can also find out which effects of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` are different from one another using `pairs()` on the `emtrends()` output:

```{r}

forCompRR <- pairs(trendsOut, 
                   simple = "Cat5")

forCompRR


```

Remember that you need to convert any predictor coefficients to the response scale when reporting.  

The table above tells you that:

* There is no evidence the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` differs when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StB` (P = 0.26).

* There is evidence that the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` is different when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StC` (P = 0.0042).  The effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` is `exp(-0.0039)` = `r exp(-0.0039)` times as big when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StC`.

* There is evidence that the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` is different when `Cat5` is `StB` vs. `StC` (P = 0.0004).  The effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.p` is `exp(-0.00652)` = `r exp(-0.00652)` times as big when `Cat5` is `StB` vs. `StC`.

Only if all the slopes were similar, you would want to test if the levels of your categorical predictor (`Cat5`) have significantly different coefficients (intercepts) from each other with `pairs()` on the output from `emmeans()` (the `emmOut` object).

### Models with a Gamma error distribution assumption:

**Background**

For models with a Gamma error distribution assumption, you will typically start with a link function that is the inverse or `link = "inverse"`.  You need to take this link function into consideration when you report your modelled effects.

For a model where `link = "inverse"`, the interpretation of the coefficients on the response scale is less clear. In this case, you would use your model to make predictions of your response and report the effects by describing these changes in predictions. We will cover making predictions in the next chapter.

**However**, you can also use `link = "log"` for your models with a Gamma error distribution assumption.  Using "log" will let you use the reporting methods in the section on "Models with a poisson error distribution assumption"(@sec-poissonModelEffects).  So, if you have a model with a Gamma error distribution assumption, use `link = "log"` for modelling, and follow the methods given above (@sec-poissonModelEffects).

---

### Models with a binomial error distribution assumption: {#sec-startBinomial}

**Background**

For models with a binomial error distribution assumption, you will typically start with a link function that is the logit function or `link = "logit"`.  You need to take this link function into consideration when you report your modelled effects.

The logit function is also called the "log-odds" function as it is equal to the logarithm of the odds.  

Models with a binomial error distribution assumption model the probability of an event happening.  This might be presence (vs. absence), mature (vs. immature), death (vs. alive), etc., but in all cases this is represented as the probability of your response being 1 (vs. 0).

If $p$ is the probability of an event happening (e.g. response being 1), the probability an event *doesn't* happen is $1-p$ when an event can only have two outcomes. The odds are the probability of the event happening divided by the probability it doesn't happen, or: 

$\frac{p}{1-p}$

The logit function (or log-odds function) is then:

$log_e(\frac{p}{1-p})$

Jargon alert!  Note that a GLM using the logit link function is also called logistic regression.

Alternate link functions for binomially distributed data are probit and cloglog, but the logit link function is by far the one most used as the coefficients that result from the model are the easiest to interpret.  But, as always, you should choose the link function that leads to the best-behaved residuals for your model.
 
Similar to reporting a rate ratio when your link = "log" (@sec-poissonModelEffects), you report your coefficients of a model with a binomial error distribution assumption (and link = "logit") on the response scale by raising `e` to the power of the coefficients estimated on the link scale.  

When you have a **continuous predictor**, $e$ is raised to the slope (estimated on the link scale) to give you an odds ratio (OR) on the response scale.  1 - OR gives you the % change in odds for a unit change in your continuous predictor.  

When you have a **categorical predictor**, $e$ is raised to the intercept of each level of your predictor (estimated on the link scale) to give you the odds associated with that predictor level on the response scale.  

Here is the math linking the coefficient to the odds ratio:

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="the math"} 

Given a binomial model, 
$$
\begin{align}
log_e(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) &= \beta_1 \cdot Cov_i + \beta_0 \\
Resp_i &\sim binomial(p_i) 
\end{align}
$$
$p_i$ is the probability of success and $1-p_i$ is the probability of failure, and the odds are $\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$.

Then the odds ratio (OR), or % change in odds due to a change in predictor is:


$$
\begin{align}
OR&=\frac{odds\;when\;Cov=a+1}{odds\;when \;Cov=a}\\[2em]
OR&=\frac{(\frac{p}{1-p}|Cov=a+1)}{(\frac{p}{1-p}|Cov=a)}\\[2em]
log_e(OR)&=(log_e\frac{p}{1-p}|Cov=a+1) - (log_e\frac{p}{1-p}|Cov=a)\\[2em]
log_e(OR)&=(\beta_1\cdot (a+1)+\beta_0) - (\beta_1\cdot a+\beta_0)\\[2em]
log_e(OR)&=\beta_1\cdot a + \beta_1-\beta_1\cdot a\\[2em]
OR &=e^{\beta_1}
\end{align}
$$

:::


One thing to note: 

The `emmeans()` function **will** convert the coefficients (intercepts) from the link to the response scale.  You can ask for this with the `type = "response"` argument.  

In contrast, the `emtrends()` function **does not** convert the coefficients (slopes) to represent effects on the response scale.  This is because `emtrends()` is reporting the slope of a straight line - the trend line on the link scale.  But the line isn't straight on the response scale.  

You need to convert from the link to the response by hand when we use `emtrends()`^[remember, the coefficients for categorical predictors are also being converted from the link to the response scale.  It is just that R is doing it for us in the `emmeans()` function when we add the argument `type = "response")].  How you make the conversion, and interpret the result, will depend on your error distribution assumption: 

<img src="./convertCoef.png" width="700px"/>

Here we will go through examples of reporting for models with a binomial error distribution assumption.  If you want more details on *why* you are using the methods below, check the section on "Models with a normal error distribution assumption" (@sec-normalModelEffects) for context.


**Examples**

Here I have made new examples where the error distribution assumption is binomial  This changes the response variables, indicated by `Resp1.b`, `Resp2.b`, etc. to be values of either 0 or 1.

Recall that Example 1 contains only one predictor and it is categorical:

`Resp1.b ~ Cat1 + 1`

The best-specified model (now with a binomial error distribution assumption) is:

```{r}

bestMod1.b

```
that was fit to data in `myDat1.b`:

```{r}

str(myDat1.b)

```

and the `dredge()` table you used to pick your `bestMod1.b` is in `dredgeOut1.b`
```{r}

dredgeOut1.b

```

And here's a visualization of the model effects:

```{r}

# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

For categorical predictors, you can get the coefficients on the response scale directly with the `emmeans()` function^[from the emmeans package] when you specify type = "response".  These are the **probabilities** (not odds or odds ratio) that `Resp1.b` = 1 at each level of your categorical predictor:

```{r}

library(emmeans) # load the emmeans package

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod1.b, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut

```
Notice that the column reported is `prob`: these coefficients are already converted back onto the response scale (as probabilities).  

Note also that two types of uncertainty are measured here.  `SE` stands for the standard error around the prediction, and is a measure of uncertainty of the average modelled effect.  The `lower.CL` and `upper.CL` represent the 95% confidence limits of the prediction - so if you observed a new `Resp1.b` at a particular `Cat1`, there is a 95% probability that the probability `Resp1.b` is 1 would lie within the bounds of the confidence limits.  

From this output you see: 

When `Cat1` is `SpA`, the probability that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,2],2)` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,5],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,6],2)` units). This is equivalent to odds ($\frac{p}{(1-p)}$) of  `r round((summary(emmOut)[1,2])/(1- summary(emmOut)[1,2]),2)`.

When `Cat1` is `SpB`, the probability that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,2],2)` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,5],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,6],2)` units). This is equivalent to odds ($\frac{p}{(1-p)}$) of  `r round((summary(emmOut)[2,2])/(1- summary(emmOut)[2,2]),2)`.

When `Cat1` is `SpC`, the probability that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,2],2)` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,5],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,6],2)` units). This is equivalent to odds ($\frac{p}{(1-p)}$) of  `r round((summary(emmOut)[3,2])/(1- summary(emmOut)[3,2]),2)`.

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`. 

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="where do these probabilities and odds come from?"} 

The emmeans package provides an easy way of seeing the effects of `Cat1` on `Resp1.b` the response scale, but you can also get this information from the `summary()` output:

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod1.b))

```
You can convert the coefficients to odds with the `exp()` function, for example: 

When `Cat1` is `SpA`, the **odds** that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `exp(coef(summary(bestMod1.b))[1])` =  `r exp(coef(summary(bestMod1.b))[1])`. And you can get the probabilities directly with the `plogis()` function (`plogis(coef(summary(bestMod1.b))[1])` = `r round(plogis(coef(summary(bestMod1.b))[1]),3)`).

:::

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

Here you can compare the effects of the levels of `Cat1` on `Resp1.b` to see if the effects differ between the levels.  

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut)

forComp

```

The output shows the results of the multiple comparison (pairwise) testing.  

The values in the `p.value` column tell you the results of the hypothesis test comparing the coefficients between the two levels of your categorical predictor.  

Note the `odds.ratio` column here. Comparing effects of `Cat1` on the probability of `Resp1.b` is done by comparing odds of `Resp1.b` being 1 under each level of `Cat1`.

For example: 

* there is no evidence that the probability of `Resp1.b` being 1 is different when `Cat 1 = SpA` vs. when `Cat1 = SpB` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[1],4)`).  

* there is little evidence that the probability of `Resp1.b` being 1 is different when `Cat 1 = SpA` than when `Cat1 = SpC` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[2],4)`).  The odds ratio is `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$odds.ratio[2],4)`. 

* there is strong evidence that the probability of `Resp1.b` being 1 is different when `Cat 1 = SpB` than when `Cat1 = SpC` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$p.value[3],4)`).  The odds ratio is `r round(as.data.frame(forComp)$odds.ratio[3],4)`.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="where did this odds ratio come from?"} 

This is a ratio of the odds of that `Resp1.b` is 1 when `Cat 1 = SpA` vs. the odds of that `Resp1.b` is 1 when `Cat 1 = SpC`:

For example, the odds that `Resp1.b` is 1 when `Cat 1 = SpA` are:
```{r}

pCat1.SpA <- summary(emmOut)[1,2]

oddsCat1.SpA <- pCat1.SpA /(1-pCat1.SpA)

oddsCat1.SpA


```

and the odds that `Resp1.b` is 1 when `Cat 1 = SpC` are:
```{r}

pCat1.SpC <- summary(emmOut)[3,2]

oddsCat1.SpC <- pCat1.SpC /(1-pCat1.SpC)

oddsCat1.SpC


```

and the odds ratio StA/StB is 

```{r}

oddsCat1.SpA/oddsCat1.SpC


```

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

and the `dredge()` table you used to pick your `bestMod2.b` is in

And here's a visualization of the model effects:

```{r}

#### i) choosing the values of your predictors at which to make a prediction

# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit

#### ii) using `predict()` to use your model to estimate your response variable at those values of your predictor

```

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

As above, we can use the emmeans package to see the effects of the predictors on the scale of the response:

```{r}


emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod2.b, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat2 + Cat3 + Cat2:Cat3, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut

```

So now you have a modelled value of your response for each level of your categorical predictors.  For example:  

When `Cat2` is `StA` and `Cat3` is `Treat`, the probability that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[4,3],2)` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[4,6],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[4,7],2)` units).  

When `Cat2` is `StB` and `Cat3` is `Control`, the probability that `Resp1.b` is 1 is estimated to be `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,3],2)` (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,6],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,7],2)` units).  

Finally, note that you can also get a quick plot of the effects by handing the `emmeans()` output to `plot()`.

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

As with Example 1, you can also find out which combinations of predictor levels are leading to statistically different model predictions in `Resp2.b`:

```{r}

forComp <- pairs(emmOut, # emmeans output
                 simple = "Cat2") # contrasts within this categorical predictor

forComp

```

Based on a threshold P-value of 0.05, you can see that the effects at some combinations of your predictors are not statistically different from each other.  For example, there is **no** evidence that the probability of `Resp2.b` being 1 when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `StA` (`r  round(summary(emmOut)[1,3],2)`)^[taken from the `emmOut` output above] than when `Cat3` = `Control` and `Cat2` = `StB` (`r  round(summary(emmOut)[2,3],2)`) are different from each other (P = `r round(data.frame(forComp)[1,8],2)`).

On the other hand, some combinations of your predictors are statistically different from each other.  For example, there is strong evidence that the probability of `Resp2.b` being 1 when `Cat3` = `Treat` and `Cat2` = `StA` (`r  round(summary(emmOut)[1,3],2)`) is less than that when `Cat3` = `Treat` and `Cat2` = `StC` (`r  round(summary(emmOut)[6,3],2)`) are different from each other (P < 0.0001).

Note that you can also get the results from the pairwise testing visually by handing the output of `pairs()` to `plot()`.

```

Recall that Example 3 contains one predictor and the predictor is continuous: 

`Resp3 ~ Cont4 + 1`

The best-specified model (now with a binomial error distribution assumption) is:

```{r}

bestMod3.b

```
that was fit to data in `myDat3.b`:

```{r}

str(myDat3.b)

```

and the `dredge()` table you used to pick your `bestMod3.b` is
```{r}

dredgeOut3.b

```

And here's a visualization of the model effects:

```{r}

#### i) choosing the values of your predictors at which to make a prediction


# Set up your predictors for the visualized fit
forCont4<-seq(from = min(myDat3.b$Cont4), to = max(myDat3.b$Cont4), by = 1)# a sequence of numbers in your continuous predictor range
  
# create a data frame with your predictors
forVis<-expand.grid(Cont4 = forCont4) # expand.grid() function makes sure you have all combinations of predictors.  

#### ii) using `predict()` to use your model to estimate your response variable at those values of your predictor


# Get your model fit estimates at each value of your predictors
modFit<-predict(bestMod3.b, # the model
                newdata = forVis, # the predictor values
                type = "response", # make the predictions on the response scale
                se.fit = TRUE) # include uncertainty estimate

forVis$Fit<-modFit$fit # add your fit to the data frame
forVis$Upper<-modFit$fit+modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame
forVis$Lower<-modFit$fit-modFit$se.fit # add your uncertainty to the data frame

#### iii) use the model estimates to plot your model fit


library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 library

ggplot() + # start ggplot
  
  geom_point(data = myDat3.b, # add observations to your plot
             mapping = aes(x = Cont4, y = Resp3.b)) + # control position of data points so they are easier to see on the plot
  
  geom_line(data = forVis, # add the modelled fit to your plot
              mapping = aes(x = Cont4, y = Fit),
              size = 1.2) + # control thickness of line
  
    geom_line(data = forVis, # add uncertainty to your plot (upper line)
              mapping = aes(x = Cont4, y = Upper),
              size = 0.8, # control thickness of line
              linetype = 2) + # control style of line
  
      geom_line(data = forVis, # add uncertainty to your plot (lower line)
              mapping = aes(x = Cont4, y = Lower),
              size = 0.8, # control thickness of line
              linetype = 2) + # control style of line
  
  ylab("probability Resp2.b = 1")+ # change y-axis label
  
  xlab("Cont4, (units)") + # change x-axis label
  
  theme_bw() # change ggplot theme



```

The model fit line may seem a little strange as the data are binary (can only be 0 or 1) but the model fit line goes through the space in between 0 and 1.  This model fit line tells you how the probability of `Resp3.b` being 1 changes as `Cont4` changes.  


**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

```{r}


trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod3.b,
                      specs = ~ Cont4 + 1, # your predictors
                      var = "Cont4") # your predictor of interest

trendsOut

```

Note that this is the same estimate as you find in the `summary()` output of your model object:

```{r}

coef(summary(bestMod3.b))

```

This is because `emtrends()` returns coefficients on the *link* scale.  

To report the coefficients on a response scale, you need to consider your link function.  Since you have a binomial error distribution assumption, you can convert the estimate made by `emtrends()` to the response scale with:

```{r}

trendsOut.df <- data.frame(trendsOut) # convert trendsOut to a dataframe

OR <- exp(trendsOut.df$Cont4.trend) # get the coefficient on the response scale

OR

```

You can also use the same conversion on the confidence limits of the modelled effect, for the upper:

```{r}

OR.up <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL) # get the upper confidence interval on the response scale
  
OR.up

```

and lower 95% confidence level:
```{r}
  
OR.low <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL) # get the lower confidence interval on the response scale

OR.low
  

```


This coefficient - called the odds ratio (@sec-startBinomial) - tells you that for a unit change in `Cont4`, the odds that `Resp3.b` is 1 increases by `r round(OR,3)` times (95% confidence interval is `r round(OR.low,3)` to `r round(OR.up,3)`) which is an increase in the odds of `Resp3.b` being 1 of `r round((OR -1)*100,1)`%. 

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="where did this odds ratio come from?"} 

You can get a better sense of the odds ratio (vs. odds vs. probabilities) by estimating it directly from the modelled probability that `Resp3.b`  is 1:

Let's find the probability of `Resp3.b` = 1 when `Cont4` is 60: 

```{r}

pCont4.60 <- predict(bestMod3.b, # model
                 newdata = data.frame(Cont4 = 60), # predictor values for the prediction
                 type = "response", # give prediction on the response scale
                 se.fit = TRUE) # include uncertainty

pCont4.60 <- pCont4.60$fit

pCont4.60

```

So there is a `r round(pCont4.60*100,1)`% probability of `Resp3.b` being 1 when `Cont4` is 60.  

The odds associated with `Resp3.b` being 1 when `Cont4` is 60 is given by the probability of `Cont4` is  divided by the probability of absence:

```{r}
oddsCont4.60 <- pCont4.60/(1-pCont4.60)

oddsCont4.60
```

Now let's find the probability of `Resp3.b` being 1 when `Cont4` is 61: 

```{r}
pCont4.61 <- predict(bestMod3.b, # model
                 newdata = data.frame(Cont4 = 61), # predictor values for the prediction
                 type = "response", # give prediction on the response scale
                 se.fit = TRUE) # include uncertainty

pCont4.61 <- pCont4.61$fit

pCont4.61
```

So there is a `r round(pCont4.61*100,1)`% probability of `Resp3.b` being 1 when `Cont4` is 61.  

The odds associated with `Resp3.b` being 1 when `Cont4` is 61 is given by the probability of presence divided by the probability of absence:

```{r}
oddsCont4.61 <- pCont4.61/(1-pCont4.61)

oddsCont4.61
```

Now the odds ratio is found by comparing the change in odds when your predictor (`Cont4`) changes one unit

```{r}
oddsCont4.61/oddsCont4.60
```

Note that this is identical to the calculation of the odds ratio from the coefficient above:

```{r}

OR

```

and you interpret this as a `OR - 1` or `r round((OR-1)*100,1)`% change in the odds of `Resp3.b` being 1 with a unit change of `Cont4`.

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

This question only applies to categorical predictors of which their are none in Example 3.

**What are your modelled effects (with uncertainty)?**

The process for estimating effects of categorical vs. continuous predictors is different.

For categorical predictors (`Cat5`), you can use `emmeans()` to give you the effects on the response scale directly:

```{r}

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod4.b, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response") # report coefficients on the response scale

emmOut
```

This output tells you that:

* When `Cat5` is StA and `Cont6` is 227 units^[the mean of the range of `Cont6`], there is a `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,3]*100)`% probability that `Resp4.b` will be 1 (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,6],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[1,7],2)`%) 

* When `Cat5` is StB and `Cont6` is 227 units^[the mean of the range of `Cont6`], there is a `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,3]*100)`% probability that `Resp4.b` will be 1 (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,6],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[2,7],2)` units).

* When `Cat5` is StB and `Cont6` is 227 units^[the mean of the range of `Cont6`], there is a `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,3]*100)`% probability that `Resp4.b` will be 1 (95% confidence interval: `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,6],2)` to `r round(summary(emmOut)[3,7],2)` units).

Note that `emmeans()` sets your continuous predictor (`Cont6`) to the mean value of `Cont6` (227 units).  You can also control this with the `at = ` argument in the `emmeans()` function:

```{r}

emmOut <- emmeans(object = bestMod4.b, # your model
            specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1, # your predictors
            type = "response", # report coefficients on the response scale
            at = list(Cont6 = 150)) # control the value of your continuous predictor at which to make the coefficient estimates


emmOut


```


For continuous predictors (`Cont6`), you need to use the `emtrends()` function **and then convert the coefficients to the response scale**:

```{r}


trendsOut <- emtrends(bestMod4.b,
                      specs = ~ Cat5 + Cont6 + Cat5:Cont6 + 1 , # your predictors
                      var = "Cont6") # your predictor of interest

trendsOut



```

Since you have a binomial error distribution assumption, you can convert the estimate made by `emtrends()` on to the response scale with the `exp()` function:

```{R}

trendsOut.df <- data.frame(trendsOut) # convert trendsOut to a dataframe

OR <- exp(trendsOut.df$Cont6.trend) # get the coefficient on the response scale

OR

```

You can also use the same conversion on the confidence limits of the modelled effect, for the upper:

```{r}

OR.up <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL) # get the upper confidence interval on the response scale
  
OR.up

```

and lower 95% confidence level:
```{r}
  
OR.low <- exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL) # get the lower confidence interval on the response scale

OR.low
  

```

Let's organize these numbers so we can read the effects easier:

```{r}
ORAll <- data.frame(Cat5 = trendsOut.df$Cat5, # include info on the Cat5 level
                    OR = exp(trendsOut.df$Cont6.trend), # the modelled effect as a rate ratio
                    OR.up = exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.UCL), # upper 95% confidence level of the modelled effect
                    OR.down = exp(trendsOut.df$asymp.LCL)) # lower 95% confidence level of the modelled effect

ORAll

```

This tells you that for a unit change in `Cont6`, the odds that `Resp4.b` is 1:

* increases by `r (round(ORAll[1, "OR"],3)-1)*100`% with a unit change in `Cont6` when `Cat5` is `StA` (95% confidence interval: `r (round(ORAll[1, "OR.down"],3)-1)*100` to `r (round(ORAll[1, "OR.up"],3)-1)*100`).

* increases by `r (round(ORAll[2, "OR"],3)-1)*100`% with a unit change in `Cont6` when `Cat5` is `StB` (95% confidence interval: `r (round(ORAll[2, "OR.down"],3)-1)*100` to `r (round(ORAll[2, "OR.up"],3)-1)*100`).

* increases by `r (round(ORAll[3, "OR"],3)-1)*100`% with a unit change in `Cont6` when `Cat5` is `StC` (95% confidence interval: `r (round(ORAll[3, "OR.down"],3)-1)*100` to `r (round(ORAll[3, "OR.up"],3)-1)*100`).


You can test for evidence that the effects of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` are significant (different than zero) with: 

```{r}

test(trendsOut) # get test if coefficient is different than zero.

```
Note that these tests are done on the link scale but can be used for reporting effects on the response scale.

From the results, you can see that the effects of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` at all levels of `Cat5` are significant (P < 0.0001).

**Are the modelled effects different than one another across categorical levels? (only needed for categorical predictors with more than two levels)**

You can also find out which effects of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` are different from one another using `pairs()` on the `emtrends()` output:

```{r}

forCompOR <- pairs(trendsOut, 
                   simple = "Cat5")

forCompOR


```

The table above tells you that:

* There is evidence that the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is different when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StB` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forCompOR)$p.value[1],3)`).  The effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is `exp(0.0954)` = `r round(exp(as.data.frame(forCompOR)$estimate[1]),2)` times as big when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StB` (i.e. the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is `r round((exp(0.0954)-1)*100)`% more when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StB`)

* There is no evidence the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` differs when `Cat5` is `StA` vs. `StC` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forCompOR)$p.value[2],3)`).

* There is evidence that the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is different when `Cat5` is `StB` vs. `StC` (P = `r round(as.data.frame(forCompOR)$p.value[3],3)`).  The effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is `exp(-0.1317)` = `r round(exp(-0.1317),2)` times as big when `Cat5` is `StB` vs. `StC` (i.e. the effect of `Cont6` on `Resp4.b` is `r round((1-exp(-0.1317))*100)`% less when `Cat5` is `StB` vs. `StC`)

Only if all the slopes^[i.e. effects associated with the continuous predictor] were similar, you would want to test if the levels of your categorical predictor (`Cat5`) have significantly different coefficients (intercepts) from each other with `pairs()` on the output from `emmeans()` (the `emmOut` object).
