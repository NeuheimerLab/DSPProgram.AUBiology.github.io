Skills will be taught in the context of current biological research.\n\n\nBest Practices\nCourse content and instruction will follow current best-practices for teaching data skills and for teaching to a diversity of students (diversity of backgrounds, learning styles). To this end, a common teaching strategy will be developed.\n\n\nCohesion\nCohesion throughout the DSP Program is necessary for student learning and mastering of skills. Program cohesion will be developed through repetition, consistency and clarity: Students will have a chance to apply skills repeatedly and regularly with DSP courses and modules positioned in as many semesters as possible. Skills will be taught with consistency with instructors using a common framework, syntax and terminology across DSP courses and modules. Learned skills will be made clear to the students as they will be explictly trained to communicate why and how they are applying skills to accomplish tasks through the development of their Data Skills Portfolio.\n\n\nResilience\nProgram development will support resilience of both the student and the program as a whole.\nStudent resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nencouraging an understanding of the “how” and “why” behind the data skills they are learning so they are aware of the general applicability of their skills.\nrepeated exposure to the training throughout their career so they have a number of opportunities to practice skills,\ndeveloping awareness of the skills they are learning through the building of their Data Skills Portfolio that follows them throughout their degree,\nfeedback opportunities where students are able to identify areas they find challenging so that swift interventions are made, and no student is left behind, and\naccessible tools: Where possible, open-source programs and languages will be taught to allow students uninterrupted access to tools after they leave their education.\n\nProgram resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nthe DSP Program being a shared goal & responsibility across sections: The program will be grounded by input from all Sections in the Department of Biology. Teaching responsibilities will shared by all Sections. The current make-up of the DSP Program Taskforce is available here.\nbuilding in redundancy in teaching responsibilities: Courses and modules will be team taught as much as possible to allow for consistency in the program in the face of staff availability changes, and\ndevelopment of maintainable online resources: Online resources (including this handbook) will be structured to maintanence as minimal as possible.",

    "section": "Data collection",
    "text": "Data collection\nThe individual needs of your project will vary, but here we will present a standard way of structuring your data and data collection that will support robust and ethical research. Specifically we will cover:\n\nChoosing what you record\nChoosing how you record it\nNaming your columns and data files\nIncluding a “ReadMe” document\nAsking questions\nBacking up your data\n\nA note on tools: You will most likely be collecting your data in a spreadsheet editor like Excel1, but these guidelines are generally applicable for however you are collecting your data.\n\nChoosing what you record\nYou should be recording the conditions along with your observations. You should also include comments made during the data collection noting unusual conditions (e.g. weather) that might affect your observations (as a comments column). When in doubt record, record, record.\n\n\nChoosing how you record it\nBest practices is to record your data in “unique record format”2. Unique record format makes it easier to track how you have collected the data, it makes it easier for two or more researchers to collaborate on the data collection, and it reduces the chance of errors in your data collection.\nRecording your data in unique record format means that:\n\nevery column is a variable of one format (either numeric or character),\nevery row is an observation,\nevery cell holds only one piece of information (i.e. a single value), and\nyou record your data in a rectangular table: this means that all columns have the same number of rows. If needed, you can fill missing information with a value to show it is missing (e.g. using NA which is what R uses to indicate a missing value)\n\nIn addition - you should make sure there is no extra white space (e.g. blank rows) above or to the left of your data.\n\nit is most flexible to record dates as separate columns for year, month and day, and, similarly, record times as separate columns of hours and minutes. The handbook goes over analysis with complicated dates columns [link TBA], but having separate columns for each variable is easiest.\nrecord a decimal using “.” not “,” as this will be most consistent for the data analysis tools we will be using. Again, there are ways of working around this in R if your data does use commas as decimals.\n\n\nNaming your columns\nMake your variable (column) names simple but informative.\nAvoid spaces in your column names - instead you can include multiple words in your column names by using “snake_case” (e.g. total_length). Avoid having units in your column names (link to readme file)\n\n\nNaming your data files\nInclude a useful name for your data file that describes the type of data in the file and the project or person related to the project, e.g. “ChristensenMSc_EnviroData.csv”\nNote that you will likely record your data in a spreadsheet editor resulting in a file with e.g. .xlsx extension. That said, you may want to save your data file as a plain text file (e.g. with .txt or .csv extension). This is because a plain text file is the most “portable” both across platforms (e.g. Windows vs. Mac) and into the future. Also, this format avoids Excel reformatting data columns that can cause confusion with interpretation. You can change how your file is saved using “Save as” in the file menu.\nHere’s an example of good data collection practice (i.e. unique record format) - it’s a file called Pedersen_ExampleData.csv:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n1a) There is no white space above or to the left of the data.\n1b) Every column is a variable that is either a numeric or a character.\n1c) Each row is a unique observation.\n1d) Each cell holds only a single piece of information.\n1e) The data are recorded in a regular table (no missing rows or columns).\nIn contrast, here is an example of what NOT to do:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in this bad-practice example:\n2a) There is white space above the data.\n2b) Some columns contain a mix of numeric and character data. Note that you it is better to give information on units (e.g. g) in the ReadMe file (see next section).\n2c) Rows contain more than one observation.\n2d) Some cells hold more than one piece of information.\n2e) The data are not recorded in a regular table (there are missing rows and columns).\n2f) A variable is not in its own column.\n2g) A column name contains white space.\n\n\n\nInclude a “ReadMe” document\nFor each data file, include a separate “ReadMe” document that describes the data. The ReadMe file documents (briefly) what the data are and where they came from. The document allows you to communicate your data to your colleagues and your future self.\nThis document should:\n\nbe a plain text or pdf document.\ninclude the name of the data file associated with the ReadMe document.\ninclude a description of where the data came from.\ninclude information on how the data can or can not be reused.\ninclude a contact person for the data and their contact details (e.g. email).\ninclude descriptions of each column, the type of data and the format of the data, including units.\ninclude a description of how missing values are recorded (e.g. NA).\n\nHere is an example of a ReadMe document to accompany the Pedersen_ExampleData.csv above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking questions\nRemember to ask questions! Asking your questions is one of the most valuable contributions you can make to science. Asking your questions will help us clarify methods, develop better strategies and stop accidents before they happen.\nIf you’re unsure how to do something - stop and ask!\nIf you’re unsure why you should do something - stop and ask!\nIf something doesn’t feel safe or comfortable - stop and ask!\n\n\nBacking up your data\nWhere to store your data [TBA]",

By developing these skills in our students, students will be more capable of successfully pursuing research projects both in their studies and post-graduate careers. Moreover, these skills are those required for data analysis tasks across fields. By developing their data skills during the program, students will be deemed more capable and attractive to a variety of data-focused career options. By focusing skills in an open-sourced programming language, students will be able to implement the tools they learnt after their degree is finished. Capable first and foremost as biologists. Practice grounded in biological theory. transferrable skills\nConfident: A major focus of the DSP program is to make the students aware of the skills they are learning (the “why” and the “how”) and the general applicability of these skills across research projects, fields and careers.

By developing these skills in our students, students will be more capable of successfully pursuing research projects both in their studies and post-graduate careers. Moreover, these skills are those required for data analysis tasks across fields. By developing their data skills during the program, students will be deemed more capable and attractive to a variety of data-focused career options. By focusing skills in an open-sourced programming language, students will be able to implement the tools they learnt after their degree is finished. Capable first and foremost as biologists. Practice grounded in biological theory. transferrable skills\nConfident: A major focus of the DSP program is to make the students aware of the skills they are learning (the “why” and the “how”) and the general applicability of these skills across research projects, fields and careers. By empowering students to see their abilities in these areas, we empower them to promote themselves when they pursue future research or career opportunities.

(Can I reject my hypothesis?)\ngiven my hypothesis, how much variation in the observations can I explain?\ngiven my hypothesis, what would I expect (predict) to observe under different times or locations?\n\nYour job then is to explain observation variability in time and space by creating a “model” of what (you think) is going on - hence statistical modelling.\nIt is important to remember that any model is only an approximation of what is going on in the real world.

    "section": "Introducing a statistical modelling framework",
    "text": "Introducing a statistical modelling framework\n\nThe focus of this section of the handbook is statistics that can be applied to your work as a biologist. For that reason, the motivation for what we are going to do together comes directly from your biological research hypotheses. As a biologist, you have a research hypothesis that you want to test. The method presented in this handbook will help you test it. You will learn how to move from biological theory to hypothesis to the statistical modelling process you will use to test your hypothesis.\nYou will learn this process of statistical modelling by walking through a “Statistical Modelling Framework”. This is a set of steps that you can use to go from your research hypothesis to designing a model, testing your hypothesis and communicating the results.\nThis handbook will walk through the parts of this framework one by one. During DSP modules throughout your degree, you will do the same in class while you practice applying the framework to case studies. In this way, you should see how the framework is generally applicable but also flexible. And after you leave the course you will be able to apply the framework to help you in your statistical analysis in other courses, your thesis, and your future career - in every case, your process will take its starting point and focus from the hypothesis that is motivating you.\nAs we will discuss later in the handbook, working through this framework will also guide you in creating the “guts” of a paper or report. As well as clarifying how and why you made your analysis choices, it will guide you in describing your motivation behind your research question (why is it worthwhile to spend time explaining this variation?) as well as the mechanisms behind your research hypothesis (why do I think X is responsible for the variation I’m trying to explain?). Once through, you’ll have a solid draft that can be the basis of a report, thesis chapter or scientific paper. We will talk about how this works in section.\nA note about our Statistical Modelling Framework: The steps in the image to the right as a linear process but it is not actually a linear process. As you will see in the examples, sometimes you will need to make best guesses5 as to what model might be useful and only after confronting the model with your data will you know if your guesses were reasonable (and useful!) - i.e. the model is a valid one that you can use to test your hypothesis. We will talk about how to find a useful model, how to choose when there are multiple options, and how to communicate your choices.\n\nSteps in the statistical modelling framework:\n\n\nResponse(s)\nHere you will define your research question by identifying your response variable(s).\n\nWhat variability are you trying to explain?\nAnd why is it worth explaining? (your motivation)\n\nNote: we’ll begin by discussing how to model hypotheses with just one response variable before discussing multiple response variable(s).\n\n\nPredictor(s)\nHere you will choose your predictor variables.\n\nwhat could explain the variability in your response?\nwhat are the possible mechanisms behind your argument?\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nHere you will see how your response and predictor variables come together to define your research hypothesis. And we will discuss how to write this hypothesis to begin building your statistical modelling.\n\n\nStarting model\nHere you will choose and fit the starting model that will be used to test your hypothesis. You will do this by choosing and communicating two key assumptions that will help you pick a useful modelling starting point. Then you will fit your model to your data (i.e. confronting your model with your data).\n\n\nModel validation\nHere you will investigate whether your model will be a useful one to test your hypothesis. Your steps here will include considering if you have correlated predictors or problems with observation dependence.\nYou will also considering if your starting model assumptions were realistic. After this step, you will have a model that you can confidently use to test your hypothesis.\n\n\nHypothesis testing\nHere you will test your hypothesis by assessing the evidence supporting your model. We will discuss a number of different methods to do this, but will focus on the model selection method as a robust way to evaluate what your model is telling you about your hypothesis.\n\n\nReporting\nHere you will report the results of your hypothesis testing.\nYou will report:\n\nyour best-specified model identified in the hypothesis testing\nthe effects (patterns) described by your model (including visualizing your model effects)\nhow well your model explains variability in your response.\n\n\n\nPredicting\nHere you will use your model to make predictions of your response under different conditions (while considering prediction limits).\n\n\n\nWhere we will begin: generalized linear models (GLMs)\nTo begin with, we will be discussing generalized linear models (GLMs) as models that can be useful to test many different hypotheses. Also, understanding how GLMs can be used to test your hypothesis will help you understand other, including more advanced, statistical models (Pongpipat_et_al_PracticalExtensionStatisticsForPsychology).\nRemember: the model you choose is just an approximation of the real world. This means that often times alternative models would be possible (models like t-tests, ANOVAs, ANCOVAs, etc.6). In fact, you may be collaborating with someone who wants to model your hypothesis with a different method. In this handbook, we compare GLMs to alternative model types here. And remember: the steps in the statistical modelling framework are generally applicable. Regardless of the method you apply, you need to ground your choices in good biological and statistical theory.",
