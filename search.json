This includes data literacy (the collecting, management, archiving and wrangling of data), computational thinking (computational logic, problem solving, pattern identification, algorithms), analytical skills (collecting and considering information, making decisions), model building and hypothesis testing, and other quantitative skills. Other terms used in the literature, community and job market are “data science” and “digital competence”. computational thinking and analytical skills. Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze and communicate with data Qlik 2019\nPortfolio: We use the term “portfolio” to represent the collection of data skills the student will acquire throughout the degree. Later modules in the program are tied to elective courses so that students will have portfolios that vary based on their experience. In all cases, the students will create an explicit Data Skills Portfolio (DSP) to develop their awareness and confidence in their skills, help clarify the applicability of their skills across disciplines, and more easily communicate their skills to future employers.",

Skills will be taught in the context of current biological research.\n\n\nBest Practices\nCourse content and instruction will follow current best-practices for teaching data skills and for teaching to a diversity of students (diversity of backgrounds, learning styles). To this end, a common teaching strategy will be developed.\n\n\nCohesion\nCohesion throughout the DSP Program is necessary for student learning and mastering of skills. Program cohesion will be developed through repetition, consistency and clarity: Students will have a chance to apply skills repeatedly and regularly with DSP courses and modules positioned in as many semesters as possible. Skills will be taught with consistency with instructors using a common framework, syntax and terminology across DSP courses and modules. Learned skills will be made clear to the students as they will be explictly trained to communicate why and how they are applying skills to accomplish tasks through the development of their Data Skills Portfolio.\n\n\nResilience\nProgram development will support resilience of both the student and the program as a whole.\nStudent resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nencouraging an understanding of the “how” and “why” behind the data skills they are learning so they are aware of the general applicability of their skills.\nrepeated exposure to the training throughout their career so they have a number of opportunities to practice skills,\ndeveloping awareness of the skills they are learning through the building of their Data Skills Portfolio that follows them throughout their degree,\nfeedback opportunities where students are able to identify areas they find challenging so that swift interventions are made, and no student is left behind, and\naccessible tools: Where possible, open-source programs and languages will be taught to allow students uninterrupted access to tools after they leave their education.\n\nProgram resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nthe DSP Program being a shared goal & responsibility across sections: The program will be grounded by input from all Sections in the Department of Biology. Teaching responsibilities will shared by all Sections. The current make-up of the DSP Program Taskforce is available here.\nbuilding in redundancy in teaching responsibilities: Courses and modules will be team taught as much as possible to allow for consistency in the program in the face of staff availability changes, and\ndevelopment of maintainable online resources: Online resources (including this handbook) will be structured to maintanence as minimal as possible.",

    "section": "Data collection",
    "text": "Data collection\nThe individual needs of your project will vary, but here we will present a standard way of structuring your data and data collection that will support robust and ethical research. Specifically we will cover:\n\nChoosing what you record\nChoosing how you record it\nNaming your columns and data files\nIncluding a “ReadMe” document\nAsking questions\nBacking up your data\n\nA note on tools: You will most likely be collecting your data in a spreadsheet editor like Excel1, but these guidelines are generally applicable for however you are collecting your data.\n\nChoosing what you record\nYou should be recording the conditions along with your observations. You should also include comments made during the data collection noting unusual conditions (e.g. weather) that might affect your observations (as a comments column). When in doubt record, record, record.\n\n\nChoosing how you record it\nBest practices is to record your data in “unique record format”2. Unique record format makes it easier to track how you have collected the data, it makes it easier for two or more researchers to collaborate on the data collection, and it reduces the chance of errors in your data collection.\nRecording your data in unique record format means that:\n\nevery column is a variable of one format (either numeric or character),\nevery row is an observation,\nevery cell holds only one piece of information (i.e. a single value), and\nyou record your data in a rectangular table: this means that all columns have the same number of rows. If needed, you can fill missing information with a value to show it is missing (e.g. using NA which is what R uses to indicate a missing value)\n\nIn addition - you should make sure there is no extra white space (e.g. blank rows) above or to the left of your data.\n\nit is most flexible to record dates as separate columns for year, month and day, and, similarly, record times as separate columns of hours and minutes. The handbook goes over analysis with complicated dates columns [link TBA], but having separate columns for each variable is easiest.\nrecord a decimal using “.” not “,” as this will be most consistent for the data analysis tools we will be using. Again, there are ways of working around this in R if your data does use commas as decimals.\n\n\nNaming your columns\nMake your variable (column) names simple but informative.\nAvoid spaces in your column names - instead you can include multiple words in your column names by using “snake_case” (e.g. total_length). Avoid having units in your column names (link to readme file)\n\n\nNaming your data files\nInclude a useful name for your data file that describes the type of data in the file and the project or person related to the project, e.g. “ChristensenMSc_EnviroData.csv”\nNote that you will likely record your data in a spreadsheet editor resulting in a file with e.g. .xlsx extension. That said, you may want to save your data file as a plain text file (e.g. with .txt or .csv extension). This is because a plain text file is the most “portable” both across platforms (e.g. Windows vs. Mac) and into the future. Also, this format avoids Excel reformatting data columns that can cause confusion with interpretation. You can change how your file is saved using “Save as” in the file menu.\nHere’s an example of good data collection practice (i.e. unique record format) - it’s a file called Pedersen_ExampleData.csv:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n1a) There is no white space above or to the left of the data.\n1b) Every column is a variable that is either a numeric or a character.\n1c) Each row is a unique observation.\n1d) Each cell holds only a single piece of information.\n1e) The data are recorded in a regular table (no missing rows or columns).\nIn contrast, here is an example of what NOT to do:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in this bad-practice example:\n2a) There is white space above the data.\n2b) Some columns contain a mix of numeric and character data. Note that you it is better to give information on units (e.g. g) in the ReadMe file (see next section).\n2c) Rows contain more than one observation.\n2d) Some cells hold more than one piece of information.\n2e) The data are not recorded in a regular table (there are missing rows and columns).\n2f) A variable is not in its own column.\n2g) A column name contains white space.\n\n\n\nInclude a “ReadMe” document\nFor each data file, include a separate “ReadMe” document that describes the data. The ReadMe file documents (briefly) what the data are and where they came from. The document allows you to communicate your data to your colleagues and your future self.\nThis document should:\n\nbe a plain text or pdf document.\ninclude the name of the data file associated with the ReadMe document.\ninclude a description of where the data came from.\ninclude information on how the data can or can not be reused.\ninclude a contact person for the data and their contact details (e.g. email).\ninclude descriptions of each column, the type of data and the format of the data, including units.\ninclude a description of how missing values are recorded (e.g. NA).\n\nHere is an example of a ReadMe document to accompany the Pedersen_ExampleData.csv above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking questions\nRemember to ask questions! Asking your questions is one of the most valuable contributions you can make to science. Asking your questions will help us clarify methods, develop better strategies and stop accidents before they happen.\nIf you’re unsure how to do something - stop and ask!\nIf you’re unsure why you should do something - stop and ask!\nIf something doesn’t feel safe or comfortable - stop and ask!\n\n\nBacking up your data\nWhere to store your data [TBA]",

    "text": "The DSP Program Handbook contains information on the DSP Program as well as resources for data collection, analysis and statistical modelling tasks.\nThe information in this handbook is provided as a resource for the AU Biology community including both those wanting to apply the skills in their own work, and those wanting to design data skills exercises consistent with the DSP Program.\n\n\n\nThere are many, many resources available for help with both programming and statistical modelling. Our intention is not to “reinvent the wheel”. Instead we aim to connect relevant data analysis and hypothesis testing strategies to your work as a biologist - both in class and out.\nThe methods contained in this handbook are not your only options. Where possible, we will give links to further information that can help if you would like to delve deeper on a subject.\n\n\n\nThe ideas and tools developed through the DSP Program are universal and not tied to a particular programming language. That said, most of our teaching takes place through the use of a scripted programming language.\n\n\nThe benefits of using a scripted programming language vs. ‘point & click’ programs (e.g. Excel, but see ### below) is that programming languages help make sure:\n\nyour analysis is kept separate from your data, and\nyour analysis is explicit and documented.\n\nWith a programming language, your original data remains unchanged during your analysis and your work-flow is documented as a complete “recipe” of what you have done. This helps you and your colleagues understand and track what you are doing, it promotes experimentation and exploration, and reduces the potential for errors in the analysis. It will also allow you to learn from one project to another where you can often transfer your code to tackle new problems.\nIt is not enough for you to trust your own work. You have to work in a way that others can trust in your work as well. Programming languages help you do that.\n\n\nYour first language should be one that is\n\nrelevant (one that matches your immediate needs),\ncommon (one that is used by your community), and\nfree (one that doesn’t require an expensive license)\n\n\n\n\nOur starting point will be the R Programming Language.\nR is a scripted programming language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and can be extended to meet all sorts of needs. R is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nWe will start with R as i) R is heavily used in biological research already, ii) R is flexible and applicable to many tasks, iii) R is open-source and free, iv) R has an extensive community supporting new learners, and v) R is already taught in a number of AU courses.\nRegardless of the language chosen, the skills you gain learning your first programming language will help you learn any other languages you want to learn in the future. This is because learning a programming language involves learning (computational thinking, or how to break down a task into steps and communicate this to a computer)1. These skills are universal to all programming languages, as well as many of the tasks you need to pursue your biological research goals.\n\n\n\nOur advice is to learn one language deeply as it is much easier to switch languages after you have developed your computational skills. If you find yourself needing a more general purpose language, try Python or Julia.\n\n\n\n\nYou will quickly note that you will not only be learning R in the DSP Program. We will also go over skills for correctly using a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Microsoft’s Excel) in your work. This is because Biologists still use Excel for a large number of tasks (e.g. designing an experiment, data collection, budgeting), and many Biology graduates need to use Excel in some aspect of their future careers. Even though Excel is not a programming language, we will still be using best practices to ensure that\n\nyour analysis is kept separate from your data, and\nyour analysis is explicit and documented.",
