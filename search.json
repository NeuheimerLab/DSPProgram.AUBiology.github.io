This helps you and your colleagues understand and track what you are doing, it promotes experimentation and exploration, and reduces the potential for errors in the analysis. It will also allow you to learn from one project to another where you can often transfer your code to tackle new problems.\nIt is not enough for you to trust your own work. You have to work in a way that others can trust in your work as well.

R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and can be extended to meet all sorts of needs. R is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nWe will start with R as i) R is heavily used in biological research already, ii) R is flexible and applicable to many tasks, iii) R is open-source and free, iv) R has an extensive community supporting new learners, and v) R is already taught in a number of AU courses.\nRegardless of the language chosen, the skills you gain learning your first programming language will help you learn any other languages you want to learn in the future.

We will also go over skills for correctly using a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Microsoft’s Excel) in your work.

Later modules in the program are tied to elective courses so that students will have portfolios that vary based on their experience. In all cases, the students will create an explicit Data Skills Portfolio (DSP) to develop their awareness and confidence in their skills, help clarify the applicability of their skills across disciplines, and more easily communicate their skills to future employers.",

Skills will be taught in the context of current biological research.\n\n\nBest Practices\nCourse content and instruction will follow current best-practices for teaching data skills and for teaching to a diversity of students (diversity of backgrounds, learning styles). To this end, a common teaching strategy will be developed.\n\n\nCohesion\nCohesion throughout the DSP Program is necessary for student learning and mastering of skills. Program cohesion will be developed through repetition, consistency and clarity: Students will have a chance to apply skills repeatedly and regularly with DSP courses and modules positioned in as many semesters as possible. Skills will be taught with consistency with instructors using a common framework, syntax and terminology across DSP courses and modules. Learned skills will be made clear to the students as they will be explictly trained to communicate why and how they are applying skills to accomplish tasks through the development of their Data Skills Portfolio.\n\n\nResilience\nProgram development will support resilience of both the student and the program as a whole.\nStudent resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nencouraging an understanding of the “how” and “why” behind the data skills they are learning so they are aware of the general applicability of their skills.\nrepeated exposure to the training throughout their career so they have a number of opportunities to practice skills,\ndeveloping awareness of the skills they are learning through the building of their Data Skills Portfolio that follows them throughout their degree,\nfeedback opportunities where students are able to identify areas they find challenging so that swift interventions are made, and no student is left behind, and\naccessible tools: Where possible, open-source programs and languages will be taught to allow students uninterrupted access to tools after they leave their education.\n\nProgram resilience will be nurtured by:\n\nthe DSP Program being a shared goal & responsibility across sections: The program will be grounded by input from all Sections in the Department of Biology. Teaching responsibilities will shared by all Sections. The current make-up of the DSP Program Taskforce is available here.\nbuilding in redundancy in teaching responsibilities: Courses and modules will be team taught as much as possible to allow for consistency in the program in the face of staff availability changes, and\ndevelopment of maintainable online resources: Online resources (including this handbook) will be structured to maintanence as minimal as possible.",
