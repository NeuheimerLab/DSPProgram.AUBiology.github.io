    "text": "Why do you need to validate your starting model?\nAs we discussed before “All models are wrong, but some are useful”. So how do you tell if your starting model is a useful one; that is, one that can be used to test your hypothesis?\nAs discussed in the last section, when you choose your starting model you make an educated guess as to what a useful starting model might be, but you can only validate that it is a useful starting model after you have fit the model to your data.\nA useful model is one that reflects the mechanistic understanding of your research hypothesis (the deterministic part of your model - your shape assumption) as well as the nature of your observations (the stochastic part of your model - your error distribution assumption)1.\nIn addition, a useful model is one that conforms to the assumptions of the method you use to test your model (e.g. GLM). The assumptions of the GLM include that your predictors are not correlated with one another, and that your observations are independent of one another.\nIn this section, we will explore each of these assumptions by considering if your:\n\npredictors are correlated with one another,\nobservations are independent of one another,\nerror distribution assumption was adequate, and\nshape distribution assumption was adequate.\n\nBy considering these four points, you can determine if your model is “well-specified” to test your hypothesis.\nIn this section, we will go over tools that will help you determine if your model is well-specified and what to do if you find yourself with a misspecified starting model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A well-specified model”\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you are trying to find “a well-specified model”. This terminology reflects the fact that more than one model2 is likely appropriate to test your hypothesis."

    "text": "A useful residual - the scaled residual\nAs mentioned above, inspecting scaled residuals gives us a method of validating our model that is generally applicable - GREAT - but it also is a method that is intuitive: The scaled residual method checks to see if your model is useful (valid) by seeing if it can even produce data that looks like the data you used to fit your model (i.e. your observations). A model that is well-specified will be able to simulate data that looks like the data used to fix it.\nWe will estimate and explore scaled residuals using functions in the DHARMa package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHARMa’s scaled residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DHARMa package uses a simulation-based approach to estimate scaled residuals. These scaled residuals are standardized to a uniform distribution regardless of the model structure.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nDHARMa uses your starting model to simulate new response data for each observation (each row in your data frame). The default is that it simulates 250 new data sets from your model6.\nDHARMa uses the simulated values at each observation to calculate the empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) of the simulated values at that observation.\nThe scaled residual for observed data point i is then defined as the value of the ECDF at the value of the observed data i (see figure to the right).\nEstimated this way, if your model is wellspecified, the scaled residuals will always follow a uniform distribution, regardless of your starting model structure. Put another way: if the observed data were created from the same data-generating process of your starting model, all values of the cumulative distribution should appear with equal probability and the DHARMa residuals will be distributed uniformly.\n\nYou can explore more about the DHARMa package here."
